In the section on Relativity, we've seen how space and time can curve. Near the Earth, this
curvature is fairly constant. The "pull of gravity" we experience is basically the same at any two
points in time. There is a gentle variation in the pull, however. This fact is made clear in the
existence of ocean tides — changing gravity from the pull of the Sun and the Moon changes the level
of water in different parts of the oceans. But we know that the gravitational "pull" is really just
curvature of spacetime, so the curvature is changing slightly in time. One of the most interesting
predictions of the General Theory of Relativity is that this changing curvature can travel through
space, much like a wave across water. If we rotate a paddle in water, waves travel out across the
surface of the water. The Earth orbiting the Sun is just like a paddle spinning and stirring up
spacetime so that gravitational waves travel out across spacetime.

 
### Reshaping Space

We can better understand what a gravitational wave is by looking at how it affects anything it
passes through. Imagine a ship on water. As a water wave passes from right to left, the ship will
rock up and down. If a gravitational wave passes in the same direction, on the other hand, the ship
grows taller, then shorter — it waves.

These waves have some important features. We are familiar with the idea of the speed of a wave on
water—this is just how far the crest of a wave moves per unit time (miles per hour, or meters per
second, for example). The same idea applies to a gravitational wave. Here, the crest is the point
where the ship is most stretched out. In the picture above, you can watch as this point moves along
the ship from right to left. For a real gravitational wave, this speed is always equal to the speed
of light. (The gravitational wave is slowed down in these pictures, because it would be very hard to
see otherwise.) Another important aspect of these waves is their wavelength. This is just the
distance between wave crests.

We can turn our boat a little to see the waves from a second perspective. Imagine the waves
broadsiding the boat. For a water wave, this will just raise and lower the boat, as it rides on the
crest and then in the trough of the wave. For a gravitational wave, the ship will be pulled and then
pinched, as we see in the pictures.

These pictures show one more interesting feature of the waves — their amplitude, or size. For the
water wave, this is the distance the ship moves up or down from its center position. For the
gravitational wave, this is the percentage of squeeze or stretch by which the wave distorts the
ship.

 
### The Sound of a Gravitational Wave
 
Watch the flag at the top of the ship's bow in the first gravitational wave picture above. As it
moves back and forth, it is following a geodesic. Nothing is pushing it back and forth; spacetime is
simply warped in such a way that the path it follows is a "straight" line. Notice especially that
the distance between the flag and the center of the ship is changing. If that gravitational wave
were passing through your head, the same thing would be happening. In particular, the distances
between parts of your ears would change. The eardrum would be moving back and forth, for
example. But this is just what causes you to experience sound. Could you hear a gravitational wave?

In principle, yes! If the gravitational wave were strong enough, and the sound it made were a pitch
humans could hear, then you would hear it passing through you. To be at the right pitch, the wave
would have to move the ship's flag up and down at least twenty times per second. Of course, if it
were strong enough to be heard, you would probably have other problems. Nonetheless, you could
amplify the sounds if you had a microphone that was sensitive enough.

One question is whether anything in Nature makes these sounds at the right pitch, and loud enough,
for humans to hear. Astrophysicists have found many sources for sounds that we actually could hear,
with a good enough microphone. The next sections will take us through a set of possible sources of
gravitational waves which may be heard in coming years. This will provide the strongest test yet for
Einstein's ideas about spacetime.
