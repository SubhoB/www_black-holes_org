One of the most important duties of Physics is to predict how things move. Newton wrote his First
Law of Motion, saying that things move in straight lines, unless some force is pushing or pulling on
them. In curved space, it's hard to tell just what a straight line is. If the curvature is fairly
smooth, however, there is a trick.

Many people through history have thought that the Earth must be flat. Some still do! Of course, most
of us accept that the Earth is one huge sphere (approximately). The flat Earth idea worked
reasonably well, though, because it is nearly flat on a human scale. And there's the trick. Looking
closely enough, a curved space will look flat, so we still know what a straight line is. We can move
just a little bit along a straight line, then stop. Look again, and we have another little straight
line to follow in the same direction. Taking many of these tiny steps builds up into one long
line. This type of line is called a geodesic, and it's the closest thing to a straight line we can
find in warped space.

For example, imagine going between two points on the Earth's surface. Suppose you want to go from
New York City to Rome, Italy, and you can't tunnel. The quickest way to go is to fly around the
surface of the Earth. These two cities are at nearly the same latitude. However, when the plane
takes off from New York, it won't be headed due East. If the pilot chose this route, the plane would
end up in Africa, or would have to be turning left for the whole trip. (See for yourself with a
little toy car and a globe.) Instead, the pilot heads a little North of East — by 33 degrees, if we
ignore winds. This way, the plane can go in a straight line, and end up in Rome. That is, the plane
can follow a geodesic to make the flying easier.

Now we can visualize the trip. The whole time, the plane can just keep flying straight and
level. The pilot doesn't need to be turning either left or right, but will end up in Rome
nonetheless. It turns out that this is also the fastest route; a "straight line" is still the
shortest distance between two points, even if it's a straight line that curves. This is, basically,
the path that flights from New York to Rome actually follow.

We've just described geodesics in space; the plane's path follows a geodesic along the
two-dimensional surface of the Earth. Geodesics can also be paths through time. In our charts of the
movements of the astronauts above, each of the lines was a geodesic — straight lines from one point
in spacetime to another. But we were imagining our astronauts to be in a nice, flat
spacetime. Interesting things happen when we take our geodesics through warped spacetime.

Just as the geodesic "straight line" from New York to Rome looks curved to us, the geodesic of an
astronaut moving through warped spacetime would look curved, too. We can see what this looks
like. For a particular type of spacetime curvature, we get the chart shown to the right.

This looks like an acceleration. In his General Theory of Relativity, Einstein kept Newton's First
Law of Motion — objects still move along straight lines (geodesics) unless something is pushing or
pulling on them. In Newton's world, this meant that the astronaut above would have to be pulled by
some force, like gravity. In Einstein's world, it may just happen that spacetime is curved, so the
astronaut only _appears_ to accelerate, while she is simply following a geodesic. Einstein
accomplished that most important duty of Physics — predicting how objects move — by understanding
how and why spacetime warps.
