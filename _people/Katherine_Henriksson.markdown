##### Biography

I currently work on creating initial data for mergers of black holes and neutron stars with Prof.
Saul Teukolsky. Large experiments such as LIGO hope to detect gravitational waves produced by
mergers of compact objects like black holes and neutron stars, which are predicted by Einstein's
theory of general relativity but have not yet be directly detected. In order to make such a
detection, accurate predictions of observed waveforms must be made by simulations of general
relativity.

Prof. Teukolsky's group is a part of the SXS collaboration, which works to create such predictions
through numerical simulations.

The mathematical structure of general relativity is such that the problem of simulating general
relativity falls to two parts: finding a self-consistent initial solution to Einstein's equations at
one particular time, and then evolving that solution forward to later times. I work on the former
part, specifically trying to allow our simulations to accommodate more compact neutron stars than we
are currently able.

I have also worked on modeling the internal magnetic field structure of neutron stars with Prof. Ira
Wasserman. In this research, we looked at the consequences for the structure of the star of
superconductivity in the core of the neutron star. This research, which integrates knowledge from
both astrophysics and condensed matter physics, aims to better understand the effect on the stellar
deformation of having an unusual state of matter in the interior. In this research I have been
supported in the past by a New York state NASA space grant.

Outside of research, I manage and run the departmental computer lab for the Physics department,
which I also played a large role in setting up in its current incarnation. I also am a chair in the
Cornell Expanding Your Horizons program, which every year hosts an all-day program for 200-300
middle school aged girls to encourage interest in the sciences. I serve on the Astronomy department
computer committee, which provides planning guidance for the department in computer policy. In
addition, I have much experience with teaching, and am currently in my ninth semester serving as a
teaching assistant for an undergraduate course.
