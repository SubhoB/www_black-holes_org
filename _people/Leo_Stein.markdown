##### Research Projects

Simulating binary black hole systems in beyond-GR theories

##### Biography

I received my BS in physics from Caltech in 2006, where my senior thesis was on coherent LIGO data
analysis with multiple detectors and sky localization. I then switched coasts to attend MIT for my
PhD in physics (2012). My doctoral thesis was on (i) numerical methods for black-hole perturbation
theory in GR, and (ii) the beyond-GR physics of gravitational waves, compact objects, and compact
binaries emitting gravitational waves. This work was under the supervision of Prof. Scott Hughes,
and with lots of collaboration with Nicolas Yunes. From 2012-2015 I was a NASA Einstein postdoctoral
fellow at Cornell University, where I continued my work on beyond-GR gravitational physics, working
in Prof. Eanna Flanagan's group. I moved to Caltech as a senior postdoctoral scholar, before
arriving at Mississippi as a professor.
