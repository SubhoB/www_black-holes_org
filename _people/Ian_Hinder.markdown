##### Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam-Golm,
Germany where I work on studying binary black hole mergers using SpEC as well as other numerical
relativity projects.

I obtained my PhD from the University of Southampton, UK, working with Carsten Gundlach on
hyperbolicity and stability of continuum and discrete formulations of the Einstein equations. I
later joined the numerical relativity group at Penn State and afterwards AEI as a postdoc.
