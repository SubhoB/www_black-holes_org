##### Biography

I received a bachelor's degree from Purdue University in 2010 with a major in physics and a major in
math.  In the summer of 2010, I worked with Julia Thom at Cornell, simulating 3-d pixel detector
designs for S-LHC.  I joined the SXS collaboration working with Saul Teukolsky in the following
summer, 2011.  An overview of my current work is in my research projects section.  In 2013, I
received my master's degree, and am working towards a PhD.
