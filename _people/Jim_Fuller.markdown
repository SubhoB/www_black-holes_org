I am interested in theoretical astrophysics, especially stellar and planetary systems. Much of my
work focuses on wave propagation within stars and planets. Applications include binary stellar
evolution, tidal interactions, stellar and planetary structure, asteroseismology, eruptive
transients, and supernovae.
