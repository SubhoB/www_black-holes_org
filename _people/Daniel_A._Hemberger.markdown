##### Research Projects

Simulating binary black hole systems to aid gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation.

##### Biography

I graduated from Oberlin College with a bachelor's degree in Physics. At Oberlin, I worked with
Prof. Dan Stinebring on a project to improve pulsar timing by correcting for scattering in the
interstellar medium. I received my Ph.D. in Astronomy from Cornell University, where I was advised
by Prof. Saul Teukolsky and worked closely on topics in numerical relativity with research
associates Lawrence Kidder and Geoffrey Lovelace. I am now a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech.
