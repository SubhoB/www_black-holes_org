I arrived at Cornell in 2008 and have been working under the direction of Saul Teukolsky to simulate
extreme spacetimes. Nearly a century ago, Albert Einstein predicted that massive objects moving very
quickly could produce gravitational waves that would travel through space and deliver information
about the distant cosmos to us on Earth. We will soon have the capacity to detect these waves with
experiments like Advanced LIGO, and they will tell us much about astrophysical objects and events in
far-off galaxies. But in order to understand these observations, scientists must compare them to
simulations of likely events, such as the inspiral and merger of black holes and neutron stars.

The SXS collaboration, consisting of researchers from Caltech, Cornell, CITA, and elsewhere, seeks
to produce these simulations using some of the largest supercomputers on the planet. My role as a
graduate student has been to improve our code and enable the simulation of new physical systems.
Many of my efforts have gone towards implementing the equations of MHD, allowing us to study the
effects of magnetic fields in neutron stars. An understanding of such effects will be crucial when
interpreting future observations from the next generation of transient surveys and gravitational
wave telescopes.

My interests extend well beyond astrophysics, however. I am always trying to learn more about
subjects like high-performance computing and cryptology, and I thoroughly enjoy teaching others
about the joys of physics and mathematics. Within the Cornell community I have helped reduce campus
energy usage through the “Lights Off Cornell!” program and have served as a committee chair for
Expanding Your Horizons – a conference introducing middle school girls to the excitement of math and
science. Away from academia, I take time to enjoy hiking, board games, photography, and British TV.
