##### Biography

I'm a first year Physics graduate student at Caltech, my work so far has been in Gravitational waves
and I'm now planning to work in Numerical Relativity. Before joining Caltech I did my undergrad in
Physics and Mechanical Engineering at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in
Rajasthan, India and my Masters thesis at ICTS-TIFR, Bangalore, India. For my thesis I worked with
Prof. P. Ajith on the effect of higher-order multipoles in the detection and parameter estimation of
binary black holes using advanced gravitational wave detectors. Prior to this I worked with Prof.
Bala Iyer on post-Newtonian templates for extreme mass ratio inspirals which typically comprise of
solar mass compact objects spiraling into super massive black holes.
