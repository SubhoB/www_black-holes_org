##### Research Projects

Spectral Cauchy Characteristic Evolution, Extraction, and Matching

##### Biography

Casey Handmer earned his BSc (Hons 1m) in Optics at the University of Sydney in 2009, subsequently
switching hemisphere and field to work on Numerical General Relativity at Caltech. Now in his fifth
year studying gravitational wave propagation for gauge free waveforms, Casey has developed an
extraction module within the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC).
