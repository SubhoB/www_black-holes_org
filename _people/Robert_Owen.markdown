##### Biography

I have been a member of the SXS collaboration from my time in graduate school at Caltech, through my
postdoctoral work at Cornell, and now into my faculty work at Oberlin College. My work with this
collaboration generally focuses on the interface of our numerical code with continuum mathematics. I
have developed and implemented methods for defining and computing the spin angular momentum on
distorted black holes, techniques that have roots in the mathematical formalisms of isolated and
dynamical horizons (introduced by Ashtekar and collaborators), as well as the "quasilocal charge"
formalism of Brown and York. I have extended this formalism to define measures of multipolar
structure, which can be used to study tidal interactions in strongly gravitating black-hole systems.
I have also studied methods for defining the pointwise algebraic speciality in strongly dynamical
numerical spacetimes. I have applied both of these last two techniques to demonstrate unambiguously
that the final remnant of numerical black hole mergers is indeed a Kerr black hole. I have also been
involved in deriving representations of Einstein's field equations that are well-behaved in the SpEC
code. In recent years, I have paid particular attention to the visualization of strong gravitational
fields, contributing to the development of the "vortex/tendex formalism," which is closely related
to the previously mentioned techniques for defining multipolar structure on dynamical horizons.
