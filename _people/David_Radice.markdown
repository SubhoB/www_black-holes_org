##### Biography

I am currently a Walter Burke Fellow in Theoretical Astrophysics and Relativity at Caltech. Before
that, I did my graduate studies with Prof. Luciano Rezzolla at the Albert Einstein Institute in
Potsdam (Germany) working on the development of new methods for general-relativistic hydrodynamics
simulations. I defended my PhD in Physics in Nov. 2013. I also hold a Master's degree in
Mathematical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano (Italy).
