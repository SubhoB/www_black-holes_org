##### Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam-Golm,
Germany where I work on studying binary neutron star mergers using SpEC as well as other computing
related projects.

I obtained my PhD from the University of Guelph, Canada working with Eric Poisson on black hole
pertubation theory and self-force problems. I later joined the numerical relativity group at
GeorgiaTech and afterwards TAPIR as a postdoc before moving to the AEI.
