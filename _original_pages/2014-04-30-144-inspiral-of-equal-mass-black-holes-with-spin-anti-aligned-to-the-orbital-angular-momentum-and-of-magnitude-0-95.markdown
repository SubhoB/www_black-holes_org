<p>The spins have magnitude 0.95, are parallel to each other, but are anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum. This simulation is described in a publication in <i>Phys. Rev. D.</i>, in press. The paper can also be accesed at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2777" target="_blank">arXiv:1010.2777</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> that aside from corrections that become important only near the time of merger, the spin function <i>χ</i> and scalar curvature <i>R</i> should agree well with -2B<sub>nn</sub> and -2E<sub>nn</sub>, respectively, where B<sub>nn</sub> and E<sub>nn</sub> are the horizon vorticity and tendicity, respectively.</p>
