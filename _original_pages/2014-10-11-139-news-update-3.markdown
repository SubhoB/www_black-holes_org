<p>Kate Henriksson and some of her fellow members of the SXS collaboration produced newer and better data for simulations of neutron stars colliding with black holes. Using advanced numerical techniques, the neutron stars they've constructed are the densest ever created, which will lead to some of the most extreme simulations in the world. Check out <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7159" target="_blank">the preprint here</a>.</p>
