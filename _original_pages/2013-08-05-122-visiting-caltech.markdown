<h3>On Campus</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://admissions.caltech.edu/documents/134-alongtheolivewalk2012_2013.pdf" target="_blank" title="Caltech self-guided walking tour">self-guided walking tour</a> provides a leisurely introduction to Caltech's lovely campus. The essentials can be found on the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/map" target="_blank" title="Caltech campus map">interactive campus map</a> or the <a href="https://cit.s3.amazonaws.com/map/Caltech-map-20110428CO.pdf" target="_blank" title="printable Caltech campus map">printable</a> version. The Numerical Relativity research group can generally be found around West Bridge (building #34 on the maps). The bookstore is in building #51. A public cafe (good place for lunch) is in building #52.</p>
<p>The Caltech Undergraduate Admissions office offers a <a href="http://admissions.caltech.edu/pasadena-and-beyond" target="_blank">very helpful guide</a> to things to do while at Caltech.</p>
<h3>Around Pasadena</h3>
<p>For food and various shopping needs, Lake Avenue is the closest place to Caltech. To find it, just walk two blocks West from campus. Good restaurants are found along its length, North from California Blvd. Two grocery stores can be found at the corner of Lake and California. Trader Joe's is on Lake, just South of Del Mar (set in quite a bit). For a quick lunch or light dinner, the Mediterranean Cafe on Del Mar, just East of Lake, is highly recommended.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/trans/transit/trans_arts.asp" target="_blank">Pasadena Arts Bus</a> runs frequently all around the Pasadena area, and is cheap and convenient.</p>
<p>A perennial favorite of visitors to Pasadena is the <a href="http://www.huntington.org/" target="_blank">Huntington</a> Library, Art Collections, and Botanic Gardens. Admission is free on the first Thursday of every month; $15 at other times, with a $5 discount given to students.</p>
<p>For nightlife around Pasadena, Old Town is a nice place to walk, eat, shop, catch a movie, or get a drink. It is found on Colorado Blvd. (3 blocks North of campus) and about a mile to the West. The <a href="http://www.icehousecomedy.com/" target="_blank">Ice House</a> is a top-rate comedy club nearby, with very reasonable ticket prices.</p>
<p>Interesting hikes of varying lengths can be found in the San Gabriel mountains to the North of Pasadena, and somewhat farther afield. One good and up-to-date reference is <a href="http://tchester.org/sgm/hikes.html" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
<h3>Around Los Angeles</h3>
<p>Public transportation is not quite as useful around Los Angeles as it is in other cities. Nonetheless, this is an option for many destinations. The Gold Line light rail runs right near Caltech Campus, and several buses pass nearby, headed downtown. Check out the <a href="http://www.mta.net/default.asp" target="_blank">Metro web site</a> for more information, including a helpful trip planner. Otherwise, a car is very useful, and saves a lot of time.</p>
<p>The main tourist destinations are Hollywood and Santa Monica. The Santa Monica beach and boardwalk are nice places to hang out and get some sun. Walking and bus tours of Hollywood are widely available. <a href="http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/hollywood/website/index.html" target="_blank">Universal Studios</a> has rides and tours of the movie and TV production lots. <a href="http://www.paramount.com/studio/" target="_blank">Paramount Studios</a> also gives interesting tours. <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/" target="_blank">Disney Land</a> needs no further explanation. <a href="http://www.lego.com/legoland/california/">LEGO Land</a> is a not-dissimilar experience aimed at kids. <a href="http://www.knotts.com/" target="_blank">Knott's Berry Farm</a> and <a href="http://www.sixflags.com/parks/magicmountain/index.asp" target="_blank">Six Flags</a> do good jobs with the usual roller coaster fare.</p>
<p>Some people enjoy <a href="http://www.tonightshowinfo.com/" target="_blank">being in the audience of Jay Leno's Tonight Show</a>. There's really no accounting for taste. For the snooty high-brow types, the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/visit/" target="_blank">J. Paul Getty Center</a> and Getty Villa, <a href="http://www.lacma.org/" target="_blank">L.A. County Museum of Art</a>, and the <a href="http://www.musiccenter.org/calendar/">L.A. Music Center</a> (with its wild Walt Disney Concert Hall) usually satisfy.</p>
