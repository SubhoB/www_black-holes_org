<h3 style="font-size: 17px;">Numerics</h3>
<p>[Any computer simulation will necessarily have finite accuracy.]</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 17px;">Stability</h3>
<p>[Error is inevitable, too. A finite computer can have only finite accuracy. That is, it cannot be completely accurate and error-free. In many cases, such error will grow uncontrollably. ]</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 17px;">Constraints</h3>
<p>[We can find an energy constraint in the problem of the falling apple.]</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 17px;">Gauge Conditions</h3>
<p>[The "Pythagorean Theorem" for skewed, stretched grids is much more complicated than the one for Cartesian grids. Einstein's equations lead to a natural skewing, stretching, and worse.]</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 17px;">Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>[If we watch a wave move across water, and hit a wall — like in a bathtub or a pool — we'll see it reflect. If the wave runs up against a gently sloping shoreline, we won't see nearly as much reflection. It is inevitable that there will be edges in a numerical simulation. Whether those edges act like walls or like gentle shorelines is a very delicate issue. It depends on our numerics, and on our equations.]</p>
