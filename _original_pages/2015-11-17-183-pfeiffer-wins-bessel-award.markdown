CITA Professor Harald Pfeiffer has been awarded a Wilhelm Bessel Research Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. The award honors Prof. Pfeifferâ€™s<span><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;outstanding research record, and invites him to a long-term research stay in Germany. &nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #07345c;">Pfeiffer, who holds the&nbsp;</span>Canada Research Chair in Numerical Relativity and Gravitational Wave Astrophysics, performs research on black holes and Neutron stars. &nbsp;He uses Canadian supercomputers to investigate what happens when such objects collide with each other. &nbsp;Of particular importance is the emission of gravitational waves, ripples in space and time itself, emitted by such collisions. &nbsp;Special-purpose gravitational wave detectors in the U.S., Europe and Japan are searching for these waves, to gain new insights into black holes and Neutron stars that emit gravitational waves, and into any other astrophysical processes that emit gravitational waves. &nbsp;Pfeiffer is also a member of the CITA research group that contributes to analyzing the data of the LIGO, Virgo and GEO gravitational wave detectors, located in the U.S., Italy and Germany, respectively.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
