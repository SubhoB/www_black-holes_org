The SXS collaboration has produced a catalog of about 90 simulations of binary black holes with spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum. &nbsp;We sample systems with both spins co-rotating, one co-rotating and one counter-rotating, or both counter-rotating. &nbsp;We compare these simulations with several waveform models in use by LIGO, and find generally excellent agreement. &nbsp;The papers can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1512.06800">arXiv:1512.06800</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1601.05396">arXiv:1601.05396</a>.
