<p>We make use of the highly rated <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/contacts-and-feedback/contact-forms/7901" target="_blank">aiContactSafe</a> component to handle the contact form on the SXS website, as it offers far more options than the default one that comes with Joomla. Most of the options have been set up properly and tested, so it is unlikely that you would need to change the setting. However, if you need to access the settings for the contact form, for example, have the messages sent to a different email, please follow the instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the backend, go to <strong>Components -&gt; aiContactSafe -&gt; Profiles</strong>. You will see this interface:
<p><img class="tnm" alt="contact" src="images/tutorials/contact.jpg" height="318" width="744" /></p>
</li>
<li>Click on <strong>SXS Contact Form</strong> - this is the form that we use for this site, and all the settings are here.</li>
<li>If you need to change the email where the web form sends to, go to the field "<strong>Email address</strong>" to edit it. Currently this email is set to <a href="mailto:questions@black-holes.org"></a><a>questions@black-holes.org</a></li>
<li>Remember to hit "Save" and you are done.</li>
<li>Please make sure you know what the other options would do before you make any changes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Editing or Adding a Field in the Contact Form</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Components -&gt; aiContactSafe -&gt; Fields</strong> (see above screenshot).</li>
<li>Click on the "<strong>Add new</strong>" button.</li>
<li>Fill in the different options</li>
<li>"<strong>Field label</strong>" is the actual text in front of the input field in front of the website form, eg, "Name", "Email Address". Don't confused it with "<strong>Field name</strong>" - which is a string that is actually used in the form code and no spaces are allowed.</li>
<li>Make sure to pick the right "<strong>Field type</strong>". Most of the common types are available, eg, radio buttons, checkboxes, even a date selector. What they call "combobox" is a dropdown selector.</li>
<li>Save!</li>
</ol>
