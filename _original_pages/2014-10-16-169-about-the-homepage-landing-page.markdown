<p>The <strong>homepage</strong> (landing page) of a Joomla website is quite special. It is unlike any other pages that is associated with a regular manu item (if you are not familiar with menu items/pages in Joomla, please read "<a href="website-update-table-of-contents/adding-a-new-page-menu-item" title="Adding a New Page">Creating a New Page (Menu Item)</a>"). For the SXS Site, it is set up so that the homepage is composed of mostly <strong>modules</strong> - some unique to the homepage (eg, the animated showcase area with the rocket, the four "The Science" big circular graphics), the others shared by both the homepage and the interior pages (eg, the Main Menu, the "Upcoming Events" module, "Our Latest Tweet" in the footer, "~ SXS Institutions ~" at the bottom).</p>
<p>The only non-module "content" on the homepage are located in the area to the left of "Upcoming Events" - this is where the "<strong>Featured Articles</strong>" are being displayed. Usually, this is where you would choose to display the latest update of the website. I will cover how to display your choice of "Featured Articles" below.</p>
<h3>Choosing "Featured Articles" for the Homepage</h3>
<ol>
<li>Currently, it is set up so that <strong>two featured articles</strong> can be display in the main body area of the homepage before pagination is added.</li>
<li>To set an article as a "<strong>Featured Article</strong>", go to <strong>Content -&gt; Article Manager</strong>. For demo, I will pick the articles from the "SXS News &amp; Updates" category as featured articles. Use the dropdown menu to filter out articles from this category (see below screenshot).<br /><img class="tnm" alt="featured articles" src="images/tutorials/featured_articles.jpg" height="276" width="632" /></li>
<li>Take a look at the column titled "<strong>Featured</strong>". You will see <strong>grey or blue circles</strong> - they can be <strong>clicked to toggle</strong> on and off to <strong>feature/unfeature</strong> an article. <strong>Blue means the article is currently being featured</strong> and will appear on the homepage.</li>
<li>To put the featured articles in order, go to <strong>Content -&gt; Featured Articles</strong>:<br /><img class="tnm" alt="featured articles ordering" src="images/tutorials/featured_articles_ordering.jpg" height="275" width="630" /></li>
<li>Click the <strong>little blue circles with arrows</strong> in the column titeld "<strong>Ordering</strong>" to put them in the order you want. The one with the smaller order number will appear on the left hand side of the one with the larger number on the homepage.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What Happen If I Set More Than Two Featured Articles?</h3>
<p>The answer is simple. You will get automatic <strong>pagination</strong> below the articles (see below screenshot), which takes away from the clean look of the website. Therefore, we recommend only having two featured articles at a time :)<br /><img class="tnm" alt="pagination" src="images/tutorials/pagination.jpg" height="347" width="566" /></p>
<h3>How Do I Add a "Read More..." Button?</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you look at the above screenshot, you can see that the "Recent Developments" article is truncated, and there is a "<strong>Read More...</strong>" orange button that allows the user to click into the full article. Currently, the <strong>homepage</strong> (landing page) and the "<strong>SXS News &amp; Updates</strong>" page are set up to show articles with "Read More..." buttons.</li>
<li>To do this, go into <strong>Article Manager</strong> and open up the article you want the "Read More..." button added to.</li>
<li><strong>Place your cursor</strong> where you want the article to be truncated (so that only the intro of the article - the part before the Read More button will be shown). There are <strong>two ways</strong> to add a "Read More" button - 1) Click the "<strong>Read More</strong>" button at the bottom of the text editor. 2) Click the <strong>"Insert Read More" icon</strong> in the icon area of the text editor (both circled in red below for you to see).<br /><img class="tnm" alt="read more" src="images/tutorials/read_more.jpg" height="457" width="517" /></li>
<li>The <strong>thick grey bar</strong> in the above screenshot is where the "<strong>Read More</strong>" button would appear. Everything after the bar will only be visible after a user clicks on the Read More button to go into the full article.</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> and you are done.</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> If you go to the "SXS News &amp; Updates" page, the <strong>article at the very top</strong> is called a "<strong>Leading Article</strong>" and the whole article will be displayed even though if it has a "Read More" button. The other articles below the leading article however, will have their "Read More" buttons displayed.</li>
</ol>
