<h3>Adding a Link to an External Website</h3>
<ol>
<li>When you are in the text editor, <strong>highlight the text</strong> that you want to use as a link, then click on the <strong>Insert/Edit link icon </strong>(circled in red below).
<p><img class="tnm" alt="insert link" src="images/tutorials/insert_link.jpg" height="198" width="477" /></p>
</li>
<li>The "<strong>Link</strong>" dialogue box would pop up as below:
<p><img class="tnm" alt="link" src="images/tutorials/link.jpg" height="475" width="441" /></p>
</li>
<li>In the field "<strong>URL</strong>", put the URL of the external link you wish to link to.</li>
<li>For the "<strong>Target</strong>" dropdown menu, select "<strong>Open in new window</strong>" - it is recommended that all links out of the SXS website be opened in a new window.</li>
<li>In the field "<strong>Title</strong>", put in a brief description of the link. Eg, if you are linking to Google, put "Google" as "Title". Most of the time, it makes sense to use the same text that you are using as the link itself. This is also the text that appears in a tool tip when you mouse over a link. It is good practice to include the Title for important links as it is useful for screen readers.</li>
<li>Click "<strong>Insert</strong>" and <strong>save</strong> the article.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Example of an external link with "NASA" as "Title":</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" title="NASA">Check out the NASA page!</a></p>
<h3>Adding an Internal Link (a page within the SXS Site)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Follow <strong>Step 1 and 2</strong> of the above section, so that you are in the "<strong>Links</strong>" dialogue box.</li>
<li>Click on the "<strong>+</strong>" sign in front of "<strong>Menu</strong>" to expand it. You will see a list of menus we use on the SXS website (see screenshot below). The "Main Menu" is the top menu bar that we see on the site (the one with orange color textured background under the logo area). If you click the "<strong>+</strong>" sign in front of "<strong>Main Menu</strong>", you will see all the navigation tabs and the subpages under each of them. <strong>Click to select</strong> the page you wish to link to.
<p><img class="tnm" alt="link internal" src="images/tutorials/link_internal.jpg" height="479" width="440" /></p>
</li>
<li>Add a short description for the link in "<strong>Title</strong>" (eg, Relativity, About Us, SXS News &amp; Updates).</li>
<li>There is <strong>no need to set the target</strong>, since this is a link within the website so the default is ok (open in the same window).</li>
<li>Hit "<strong>Insert</strong>" and "<strong>Save</strong>" the article.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Example of an internal link</h4>
<p><a href="index.php?Itemid=200" title="White Dwarfs">Read more about White Dwarfs!</a></p>
<h3>Adding a Button Link</h3>
<p>A button is just a regular link that is styled to look like a button. You can transform any links, internal or external, to a button if needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start from <strong>Step 1 to Step 4 above to add a link normally.</strong></li>
<li>Stay in the "<strong>Links</strong>" dialogue box (do not click "insert" just yet).</li>
<li>Click on the "<strong>Advanced</strong>" tab (see screenshot below).</li>
<li>In the "<strong>Classes</strong>" field, put in "<strong>button</strong>" (see screenshot below).
<p><img class="tnm" alt="adding a button" src="images/tutorials/button.jpg" height="485" width="445" /></p>
</li>
<li>Hit "<strong>Insert</strong>" and "<strong>Save</strong>".</li>
</ol>
<h4>Example of a Button Link</h4>
<p><a href="index.php?Itemid=321" class="button" title="SXS Team">Meet the SXS Team</a></p>
