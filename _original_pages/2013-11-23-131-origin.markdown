<p>A particular point with respect to which positions are measured.&nbsp; For example, positions on the Earth are frequently measured relative to the point on the Equator which is due South of Greenwich, England.&nbsp; In GPS coordinates, that point is given as 0,0 (its latitude is 0, and its longitude is 0).&nbsp; Or we might say something like “10 miles southeast of town hall.”&nbsp; In that case, town hall would be the origin.</p>
