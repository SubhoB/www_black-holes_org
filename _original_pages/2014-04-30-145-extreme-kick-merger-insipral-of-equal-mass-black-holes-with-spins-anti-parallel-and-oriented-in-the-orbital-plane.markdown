<p>The spins of the black holes are anti-parallel, oriented in the orbital plane, and are of magnitude 0.5. In this configuration, the kick of the final black hole has been observed in simulations by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/grqc/0702133" target="_blank">Campanelli et. al.</a> to depend on the phase of the binary at the time of merger; more specifically, they found that the kick depended sinusoidally upon the angle between the initial momenta of the BHs and the spins. This simulation will be detailed a future publication in progress; it is discussed in a paper simbitted to <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i>, available at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4869" target="_blank">arXiv:1012.4869</a>.</p>
