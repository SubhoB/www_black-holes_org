# The black-holes.org public site

This repo contains the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) code responsible for creating the public
portion of the black-holes.org site.  Basically, this means that we can write pages for the site as
standard markdown, and it will be rendered for us to a nice, fancy website.  Currently, github
automatically does this rendering for us because it detects jekyll files in the `gh-pages` branch,
though it would also be possible to render manually via github actions if we need to use features
github doesn't enable by default.

See the rendered site [here](https://moble.github.io/www_black-holes_org).


## Writing your own posts

One of the goals of making this website more usable is to encourage SXS members to write entries
about their research for the site.  The two most recent entries show up on the homepage under
"Recent Research", along with brief synopses and links to the full description.

To write your own entry, just create a Pull Request on this repo, with a file as described below.
This file should be [github-flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (basically [standard
markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with a few extensions), but you need to remember a few
points to get it published:

1. You *must* put the file in the `_posts` directory

2. You *must* name the file starting with the date as `YYYY-MM-DD-awesome_file_name.md` (where you
   get to pick the awesome name, but the date should be its actual value)

3. You *must* start the file with your title — something like this:
    ```
    # The title of my awesome research
    ```
    Again, you get to pick the title, but nothing other than whitespace should appear in the file
    before this line (unless you're getting fancy with adding YAML front matter...).  Try to keep
    the title quite short so that it fits in its place on the homepage, and maybe not so technical
    so that the public have a chance of understanding it.

4. The first paragraph will be used on the homepage to advertise this post, so think of this part as
   your [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch).  Try to limit the jargon in
   this part, since it's the part that most non-scientists will see.  Try to keep it brief, but also
   include a little motivation and the most important conclusions.

5. The rest of the post can be as long as you like — though remember that this isn't the paper.
   Long technical details should go in a paper; this is for communicating your results to people who
   are mostly science literate, but not as technically knowledgeable as you.

6. If you need to include figures, you'll want to use PNG; PDFs do not embed well, and JPGs get
   fuzzy too easily.  The files should be placed in `images/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-other-file-name.png`,
   and you can add them to your page with code like
   ```
   Here's the picture: ![Description of image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-other-file-name.png)
   ```
   If you want to adjust attributes of the image like width and height, you can use [span inline
   attribute lists](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#span-ials): *immediately* after the
   image code above (with no whitespace in between), add something like this:
   ```
   {:height="313px" width="600px"}
   ```

7. Remember to link to the *free* (presumably arXiv) version of your paper.


## Embedding Youtube videos

[This very clever tip](http://www.beingy.net/blog/embed-youtube-video-in-jekyll/) allows us to
simply use code in our pages like this:
```
{% include youtube-embed.html id="Zt8Z_uzG71o" %}
```
Basically, all the hassle of writing the HTML for embedding youtube videos has been offloaded to the
single file `_includes/youtube-embed.html`, and we just specify the ID of the video as a parameter
on the page we're writing.


## To Do

- [x] Add page collecting all research posts
- [x] Add "Explore" and quote to homepage
- [x] Move `assets` to root; we don't have many JS or CSS things anyway, and the extra characters are
      annoying
- [x] Breadcrumbs and/or sub-navigation in sidebar for main pages
- [x] Add Prev/Next buttons in the main pages
- [x] Randomly select a sidebar quote for pages that don't have one specified
- [x] Create menu automatically from ~~pages~~ `_data/menu.yml`
- [ ] Fix menu on mobile devices
- [ ] Fix navigation coins on homepage, so that they're in rows of 4, 2, or 1
- [ ] Add navigation coins in the sidebar for articles
- [ ] "Featured Video" in sidebar?
- [ ] Streamline CSS, so that only the necessary elements get served: one for homepage, another for
      everything else; maybe get rid of Bulma?
- [ ] Styling on the about-sxs/people page is very broken
- [ ] Style audio so that it's visible
- [ ] Switch to the SVG logo, using
      [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?preview.text=IMULATING%20ETREME%20PACETIMES&preview.text_type=custom&query=ubuntu)
      for the title and
      [Yellowtail](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yellowtail?category=Handwriting&preview.text=Black%20holes,%20neutron%20stars,%20and%20beyond%E2%80%A6&preview.text_type=custom&slant=8&subset=latin)
      or similar for the extras
- [ ] Automate glossary links?  (This would presumably require some non-standard plugin, and thus
      more CI work)
- [ ] Add `index.md` files in every relevant directory
- [ ] Add redirects for old ugly pages with
      [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from), which is allowed on github
- [ ] Update old `.markdown` files to actually use markdown and have correct front matter
- [ ] Make the FAQ something like [the old one](https://www.black-holes.org/explore/faq)
- [ ] Correct Next/Prev buttons to use `_data/menu.yml`
- [ ] Convert old Flash animations to use CSS or JavaScript


## Fonts used on the SXS website

[The following is from the style guide written by our original web developer, Yvonne Tang.]
 
We made use of high quality free webfonts available through the [Google Font API]("https://www.google.com/fonts"). This allows everyone to be able to experience the website in the font we specified, even though the font might not be installed on the person's own computer/device.

[Open Sans]("https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans") - The font we use for body text, eg, this current line you are reading. This is also the font we use for Heading 3 and Heading 5.

[Oswald]("https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald") - This font we use for Heading 2 (eg, the title of this article), top level navigation of the Main Menu, titles of the modules on the sidebar and footer.

**Georgia** - This is not a Google Font, but a common serif font that is installed on most computers. This font is used for Heading 4, as well as blockquotes ("Inspiration" on the sidebar, and some quotes on the Science pages).
