<p>A modern physical theory which is vital to describing extremely small objects, like electrons around an atom. Though this theory also applies to larger objects, its effects become very similar to those of Newton's theory â€” which is typically much easier to use and understand. One of the most important ideas in Quantum Mechanics is the Uncertainty Principle.</p>
