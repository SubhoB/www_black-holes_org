<p>The principle of Quantum Mechanics — as well as Quantum Field Theory and String Theory — which says that an observer can never know both the position and velocity of a particle with perfect precision. Specifically, the more certain an observer is of the position, the less certain that observer must be of the velocity, and vice-versa.</p>
