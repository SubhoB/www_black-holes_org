  A generic, noneccentric binary black hole (BBH) system emits
  gravitational waves (GWs) that are completely described by seven
  intrinsic parameters: the black hole spin vectors and the ratio of
  their masses. Simulating a BBH coalescence by solving Einstein’s
  equations numerically is computationally expensive, requiring days
  to months of computing resources for a single set of parameter
  values. Since theoretical predictions of the GWs are often needed
  for many different source parameters, a fast and accurate model is
  essential. We present the first surrogate model for GWs from the
  coalescence of BBHs including all seven dimensions of the intrinsic
  noneccentric parameter space. The surrogate model, which we call
  NRSur7dq2, is built from the results of 744 numerical relativity
  simulations. NRSur7dq2 covers spin magnitudes up to 0.8 and mass
  ratios up to 2, includes all ℓ≤4 modes, begins about 20 orbits
  before merger, and can be evaluated in ∼50  ms. We find the largest
  NRSur7dq2 errors to be comparable to the largest errors in the
  numerical relativity simulations, and more than an order of
  magnitude smaller than the errors of other waveform models. Our
  model, and more broadly the methods developed here, will enable
  studies that were not previously possible when using highly accurate
  waveforms, such as parameter inference and tests of general
  relativity with GW observations.
