  Inspiral of binary black holes occurs over a time-scale of many
  orbits, far longer than the dynamical time-scale of the individual
  black holes. Explicit evolutions of a binary system therefore
  require excessively many time steps to capture interesting dynamics.
  We present a strategy to overcome the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
  condition in such evolutions, one relying on modern implicit-
  explicit ODE solvers and multidomain spectral methods for elliptic
  equations. Our analysis considers the model problem of a forced
  scalar field propagating on a generic curved background.
  Nevertheless, we encounter and address a number of issues pertinent
  to the binary black hole problem in full general relativity.
  Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry in Kerr-Schild
  coordinates, we document the results of several numerical
  experiments testing our strategy.
