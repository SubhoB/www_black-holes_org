  We compare GW150914 directly to simulations of coalescing binary
  black holes in full general relativity, including several performed
  specifically to reproduce this event. Our calculations go beyond
  existing semianalytic models, because for all simulations—including
  sources with two independent, precessing spins—we perform
  comparisons which account for all the spin-weighted quadrupolar
  modes, and separately which account for all the quadrupolar and
  octopolar modes. Consistent with the posterior distributions
  reported by Abbott et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 241102 (2016)] (at
  the 90% credible level), we find the data are compatible with a wide
  range of nonprecessing and precessing simulations. Follow-up
  simulations performed using previously estimated binary parameters
  most resemble the data, even when all quadrupolar and octopolar
  modes are included. Comparisons including only the quadrupolar modes
  constrain the total redshifted mass Mz∈[64  M⊙-82  M⊙], mass ratio
  1/q=m2/m1∈[0.6,1], and effective aligned spin χeff∈[-0.3,0.2], where
  χeff=(S1/m1+S2/m2)·L^/M. Including both quadrupolar and octopolar
  modes, we find the mass ratio is even more tightly constrained. Even
  accounting for precession, simulations with extreme mass ratios and
  effective spins are highly inconsistent with the data, at any mass.
  Several nonprecessing and precessing simulations with similar mass
  ratio and χeff are consistent with the data. Though correlated, the
  components’ spins (both in magnitude and directions) are not
  significantly constrained by the data: the data is consistent with
  simulations with component spin magnitudes a1,2 up to at least 0.8,
  with random orientations. Further detailed follow-up calculations
  are needed to determine if the data contain a weak imprint from
  transverse (precessing) spins. For nonprecessing binaries,
  interpolating between simulations, we reconstruct a posterior
  distribution consistent with previous results. The final black
  hole’s redshifted mass is consistent with Mf,z in the range
  64.0  M⊙-73.5  M⊙ and the final black hole’s dimensionless spin
  parameter is consistent with af=0.62–0.73. As our approach invokes
  no intermediate approximations to general relativity and can
  strongly reject binaries whose radiation is inconsistent with the
  data, our analysis provides a valuable complement to Abbott et al.
