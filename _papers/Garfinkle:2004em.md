  We use the numerical solution describing the evolution of a
  perturbed black string presented in Choptuik et al. (2003) to
  elucidate the intrinsic behavior of the horizon. It is found that by
  the end of the simulation, the affine parameter on the horizon has
  become very large and the expansion and shear of the horizon in turn
  very small. This suggests the possibility that the horizon might
  pinch off in infinite affine parameter.
