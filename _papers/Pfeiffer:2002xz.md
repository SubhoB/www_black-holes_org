  We compare the results of constructing binary black hole initial
  data with three different decompositions of the constraint equations
  of general relativity. For each decomposition we compute the initial
  data using a superposition of two Kerr-Schild black holes to fix the
  freely specifiable data. We find that these initial-data sets differ
  significantly, with the ADM energy varying by as much as 5% of the
  total mass. We find that all initial-data sets currently used for
  evolutions might contain unphysical gravitational radiation of the
  order of several percent of the total mass. This is comparable to
  the amount of gravitational-wave energy observed during the evolved
  collision. More astrophysically realistic initial data will require
  more careful choices of the freely specifiable data and boundary
  conditions for both the metric and extrinsic curvature. However, we
  find that the choice of extrinsic curvature affects the resulting
  data sets more strongly than the choice of conformal metric.
