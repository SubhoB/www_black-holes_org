  We present a new code for solving the coupled Einstein-hydrodynamics
  equations to evolve relativistic, self-gravitating fluids. The
  Einstein field equations are solved on one grid using pseudospectral
  methods, while the fluids are evolved on another grid by finite
  differencing. We discuss implementation details, such as the
  communication between the grids and the treatment of stellar
  surfaces, and present code tests.
