  A shortcoming of current binary black-hole initial data is the
  generation of spurious gravitational radiation, so-called junk
  radiation, when they are evolved. This problem is a consequence of
  an oversimplified modeling of the binary's physics in the initial
  data. Since junk radiation is not astrophysically realistic, it
  contaminates the actual waveforms of interest and poses a numerical
  nuisance. The work here presents a further step towards mitigating
  and understanding the origin of this issue, by incorporating
  post-Newtonian results in the construction of constraint-satisfying
  binary black-hole initial data. Here we focus on including realistic
  tidal deformations of the black holes in the initial data, by
  building on the method of superposing suitably chosen black hole
  metrics to compute the conformal data. We describe the details of
  our initial data for an equal-mass and nonspinning binary, compute
  the subsequent relaxation of horizon quantities in evolutions, and
  quantify the amount of junk radiation that is generated. These
  results are contrasted with those obtained with the most common
  choice of conformally flat (CF) initial data, as well as superposed
  Kerr-Schild (SKS) initial data. We find that when realistic tidal
  deformations are included, the early transients in the horizon
  geometries are significantly reduced, along with smaller deviations
  in the relaxed black hole masses and spins from their starting
  values. Likewise, the junk radiation content in the l=2 modes is
  reduced by a factor of ∼1.7 relative to CF initial data, but only by
  a factor of ∼1.2 relative to SKS initial data. More prominently, the
  junk radiation content in the 3≤l≤8 modes is reduced by a factor of
  ∼5 relative to CF initial data, and by a factor of ∼2.4 relative to
  SKS initial data.
