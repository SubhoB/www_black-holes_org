  Construction of binary black hole initial data is a prerequisite for
  numerical evolutions of binary black holes. This paper reports
  improvements to the binary black hole initial data solver in the
  Spectral Einstein Code, to allow robust construction of initial data
  for mass-ratio above 10:1, and for dimensionless black hole spins
  above 0.9, while improving efficiency for lower mass-ratios and
  spins. We implement a more flexible domain decomposition, adaptive
  mesh refinement and an updated method for choosing free parameters.
  We also introduce a new method to control and eliminate residual
  linear momentum in initial data for precessing systems, and
  demonstrate that it eliminates gravitational mode mixing during the
  evolution. Finally, the new code is applied to construct initial
  data for hyperbolic scattering and for binaries with very small
  separation.
