  We present a code for solving the coupled Einstein-hydrodynamics
  equations to evolve relativistic, self-gravitating fluids. The
  Einstein field equations are solved in generalized harmonic
  coordinates on one grid using pseudospectral methods, while the
  fluids are evolved on another grid using shock-capturing finite
  difference or finite volume techniques. We show that the code
  accurately evolves equilibrium stars and accretion flows. Then we
  simulate an equal-mass nonspinning black hole-neutron star binary,
  evolving through the final four orbits of inspiral, through the
  merger, to the final stationary black hole. The gravitational
  waveform can be reliably extracted from the simulation.
