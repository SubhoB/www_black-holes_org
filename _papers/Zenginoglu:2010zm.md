  We present the numerical implementation of a clean solution to the
  outer boundary and radiation extraction problems within the 3+1
  formalism for hyperbolic partial differential equations on a given
  background. Our approach is based on compactification at null
  infinity in hyperboloidal scri fixing coordinates. We report
  numerical tests for the particular example of a scalar wave equation
  on Minkowski and Schwarzschild backgrounds. We address issues
  related to the implementation of the hyperboloidal approach for the
  Einstein equations, such as nonlinear source functions, matching,
  and evaluation of formally singular terms at null infinity.
