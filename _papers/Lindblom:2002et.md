  The Einstein evolution equations may be written in a variety of
  equivalent analytical forms, but numerical solutions of these
  different formulations display a wide range of growth rates for
  constraint violations. For symmetric hyperbolic formulations of the
  equations, an exact expression for the growth rate is derived using
  an energy norm. This expression agrees with the growth rate
  determined by numerical solution of the equations. An approximate
  method for estimating the growth rate is also derived. This estimate
  can be evaluated algebraically from the initial data, and is shown
  to exhibit qualitatively the same dependence as the
  numerically-determined rate on the parameters that specify the
  formulation of the equations. This simple rate estimate therefore
  provides a useful tool for finding the most well-behaved forms of
  the evolution equations.
