  A new gauge driver is introduced for the GH (generalized harmonic)
  representation of Einstein's equation. This new driver allows a
  rather general class of gauge conditions to be implemented in a way
  that maintains the hyperbolicity of the combined evolution system.
  This driver is more stable and effective, and unlike previous
  drivers, allows stable evolutions using the dual-frame evolution
  technique. Some useful new gauge conditions are also introduced, in
  which the lapse and the spatial coordinates satisfy damped-wave
  equations. Appropriate boundary conditions for this new gauge driver
  are constructed, and a new boundary condition for the 'gauge'
  components of the spacetime metric in the GH Einstein system is
  introduced. The stability and effectiveness of this new gauge driver
  and the new damped-wave coordinate conditions are demonstrated
  through numerical tests using evolutions of single black-hole
  spacetimes with large amplitude gauge perturbations.
