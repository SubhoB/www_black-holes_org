  We present a new numerical scheme to solve the initial value problem
  for black hole-neutron star binaries. This method takes advantage of
  the flexibility and fast convergence of a multidomain spectral
  representation of the initial data to construct high-accuracy
  solutions at a relatively low computational cost. We provide
  convergence tests of the method for both isolated neutron stars and
  irrotational binaries. In the second case, we show that we can
  resolve the small inconsistencies that are part of the
  quasi-equilibrium formulation, and that these inconsistencies are
  significantly smaller than observed in previous works. The
  possibility of generating a wide variety of initial data is also
  demonstrated through two new configurations inspired by results from
  binary black holes. First, we show that choosing a modified
  Kerr-Schild conformal metric instead of a flat conformal metric
  allows for the construction of quasi-equilibrium binaries with a
  spinning black hole. Second, we construct binaries in
  low-eccentricity orbits, which are a better approximation to
  astrophysical binaries than quasi-equilibrium systems.
