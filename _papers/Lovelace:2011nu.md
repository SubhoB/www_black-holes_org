  Motivated by the possibility of observing gravitational waves from
  merging black holes whose spins are nearly extremal (i.e., 1 in
  dimensionless units), we present numerical waveforms from
  simulations of merging black holes with the highest spins simulated
  to date: (1) a 25.5-orbit inspiral, merger, and ringdown of two
  holes with equal masses and spins of magnitude 0.97 aligned with the
  orbital angular momentum/ and (2) a previously reported 12.5-orbit
  inspiral, merger, and ringdown of two holes with equal masses and
  spins of magnitude 0.95 anti-aligned with the orbital angular
  momentum. First, we consider the horizon mass and spin evolution of
  the new aligned-spin simulation. During the inspiral, the horizon
  area and spin evolve in remarkably close agreement with Alvi's
  analytic predictions, and the remnant hole's final spin agrees
  reasonably well with several analytic predictions. We also find that
  the total energy emitted by a real astrophysical system with these
  parameters---almost all of which is radiated during the time
  included in this simulation---would be 10.952% of the initial mass
  at infinite separation. Second, we consider the gravitational
  waveforms for both simulations. After estimating their
  uncertainties, we compare the waveforms to several post-Newtonian
  approximants, finding significant disagreement well before merger,
  although the phase of the TaylorT4 approximant happens to agree
  remarkably well with the numerical prediction in the aligned-spin
  case. We find that the post-Newtonian waveforms have sufficient
  uncertainty that hybridized waveforms will require far longer
  numerical simulations (in the absence of improved post-Newtonian
  waveforms) for accurate parameter estimation of low-mass binary
  systems.
