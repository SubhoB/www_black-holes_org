  When one splits spacetime into space plus time, the Weyl curvature
  tensor (vacuum Riemann tensor) gets split into two spatial,
  symmetric, and trace-free (STF) tensors: (i) the Weyl tensor's
  so-called "electric" part or tidal field, and (ii) the Weyl tensor's
  so-called "magnetic" part or frame-drag field. Being STF, the tidal
  field and frame-drag field each have three orthogonal eigenvector
  fields which can be depicted by their integral curves. We call the
  integral curves of the tidal field's eigenvectors tendex lines, we
  call each tendex line's eigenvalue its tendicity, and we give the
  name tendex to a collection of tendex lines with large
  tendicity. The analogous quantities for the frame-drag field are
  vortex lines, their vorticities, and vortexes. We build up physical
  intuition into these concepts by applying them to a variety of
  weak-gravity phenomena: a spinning, gravitating point particle, two
  such particles side by side, a plane gravitational wave, a point
  particle with a dynamical current-quadrupole moment or dynamical
  mass-quadrupole moment, and a slow-motion binary system made of
  nonspinning point particles. [Abstract is abbreviated; full abstract
  also mentions additional results.]
