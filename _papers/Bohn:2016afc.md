abstract: |
  With Advanced LIGO detecting the gravitational waves emitted from a
  pair of merging black holes in late 2015, we have a new perspective
  into the strong field regime of binary black hole systems. Event
  horizons are the defining features of such black hole spacetimes. We
  introduce a new code for locating event horizons in numerical
  simulations based on a Delaunay triangulation on a topological
  sphere. The code can automatically refine arbitrary regions of the
  event horizon surface to find and explore features such as the hole
  in a toroidal event horizon, as discussed in our companion paper. We
  also investigate various ways of integrating the geodesic equation
  and find evolution equations that can be integrated efficiently with
  high accuracy.
