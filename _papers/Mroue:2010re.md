  We compare different methods of computing the orbital eccentricity
  of quasi-circular binary black hole systems using the orbital
  variables and gravitational wave phase and frequency. For
  eccentricities of about a per cent, most methods work
  satisfactorily. For small eccentricity, however, the gravitational
  wave phase allows a particularly clean and reliable measurement of
  the eccentricity. Furthermore, we measure the decay of the orbital
  eccentricity during the inspiral and find reasonable agreement with
  post-Newtonian results. Finally, we measure the periastron advance
  of non-spinning binary black holes, and we compare them to post-
  Newtonian approximations. With the low uncertainty in the
  measurement of the periastron advance, we positively detect
  deviations between fully numerical simulations and post-Newtonian
  calculations.
