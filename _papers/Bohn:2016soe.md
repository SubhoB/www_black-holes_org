  We find the first binary black hole event horizon with a toroidal
  topology. It has been predicted that generically the event horizons
  of merging black holes should briefly have a toroidal topology.
  However, such a phase has never been seen in numerical simulations.
  Instead, in all previous simulations, the topology of the event
  horizon transitions directly from two spheres during the inspiral to
  a single sphere as the black holes merge. We find a coordinate
  transformation to a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces that “cut a
  hole” through the event horizon surface, resulting in a toroidal
  event horizon, thus reconciling the numerical work with theoretical
  expectations. The demonstration requires extremely high numerical
  precision, which is made possible by a new event horizon code
  described in a companion paper. A torus could potentially provide a
  mechanism for violating topological censorship. However, these
  toroidal event horizons satisfy topological censorship by
  construction, because we can always trivially apply the inverse
  coordinate transformation to remove the topological feature.
