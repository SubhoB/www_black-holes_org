  We present results on the inspiral, merger, and postmerger evolution
  of a neutron star-neutron star (NSNS) system. Our results are
  obtained using the hybrid pseudospectral-finite volume Spectral
  Einstein Code (SpEC). To test our numerical methods, we evolve an
  equal-mass system for ≈22 orbits before merger. This waveform is the
  longest waveform obtained from fully general-relativistic
  simulations for NSNSs to date. Such long (and accurate) numerical
  waveforms are required to further improve semianalytical models used
  in gravitational wave data analysis, for example, the effective one
  body models. We discuss in detail the improvements to SpEC’s ability
  to simulate NSNS mergers, in particular mesh refined grids to better
  resolve the merger and postmerger phases. We provide a set of
  consistency checks and compare our results to NSNS merger
  simulations with the independent bam code. We find agreement between
  them, which increases confidence in results obtained with either
  code. This work paves the way for future studies using long
  waveforms and more complex microphysical descriptions of neutron
  star matter in SpEC.
