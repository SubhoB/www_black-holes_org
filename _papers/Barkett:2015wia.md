  Gravitational waves from binary neutron star (BNS) and black
  hole/neutron star (BHNS) inspirals are primary sources for detection
  by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
  The tidal forces acting on the neutron stars induce changes in the
  phase evolution of the gravitational waveform, and these changes can
  be used to constrain the nuclear equation of state. Current methods
  of generating BNS and BHNS waveforms rely on either computationally
  challenging full 3D hydrodynamical simulations or approximate
  analytic solutions. We introduce a new method for computing inspiral
  waveforms for BNS/BHNS systems by adding the post-Newtonian (PN)
  tidal effects to full numerical simulations of binary black holes
  (BBHs), effectively replacing the nontidal terms in the PN expansion
  with BBH results. Comparing a waveform generated with this method
  against a full hydrodynamical simulation of a BNS inspiral yields a
  phase difference of <1 radian over ∼15 orbits. The numerical phase
  accuracy required of BNS simulations to measure the accuracy of the
  method we present here is estimated as a function of the tidal
  deformability parameter λ.
