  The most promising way to compute the gravitational waves emitted by
  binary black holes (BBHs) in their last dozen orbits, where
  post-Newtonian techniques fail, is a quasistationary approximation
  introduced by Detweiler and being pursued by Price and others. In
  this approximation the outgoing gravitational waves at infinity and
  downgoing gravitational waves at the holes' horizons are replaced by
  standing waves so as to guarantee that the spacetime has a helical
  Killing vector field. Because the horizon generators will not, in
  general, be tidally locked to the holes' orbital motion, the
  standing waves will destroy the horizons, converting the black holes
  into naked singularities that resemble black holes down to near the
  horizon radius. This paper uses a spherically symmetric,
  scalar-field model problem to explore in detail the following BBH
  issues: (i) The destruction of a horizon by the standing waves. (ii)
  The accuracy with which the resulting naked singularity resembles a
  black hole. (iii) The conversion of the standing-wave spacetime
  (with a destroyed horizon) into a spacetime with downgoing waves by
  the addition of a "radiation-reaction field". (iv) The accuracy with
  which the resulting downgoing waves agree with the downgoing waves
  of a true black-hole spacetime (with horizon). The model problem
  used to study these issues consists of a Schwarzschild black hole
  endowed with spherical standing waves of a scalar field. It is found
  that the spacetime metric of the singular, standing-wave spacetime,
  and its radiation-reaction-field-constructed downgoing waves are
  quite close to those for a Schwarzschild black hole with downgoing
  waves -- sufficiently close to make the BBH quasistationary
  approximation look promising for non-tidally-locked black holes.
