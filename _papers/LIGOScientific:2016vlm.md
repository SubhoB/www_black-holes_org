  On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
  Observatory (LIGO) detected a gravitational-wave transient
  (GW150914); we characterize the properties of the source and its
  parameters. The data around the time of the event were analyzed
  coherently across the LIGO network using a suite of accurate
  waveform models that describe gravitational waves from a compact
  binary system in general relativity. GW150914 was produced by a
  nearly equal mass binary black hole of masses 36-4+5M⊙ and 29-4+4M⊙;
  for each parameter we report the median value and the range of the
  90% credible interval. The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more
  massive black hole is bound to be <0.7 (at 90% probability). The
  luminosity distance to the source is 410-180+160  Mpc, corresponding
  to a redshift 0.09-0.04+0.03 assuming standard cosmology. The source
  location is constrained to an annulus section of 610  deg2,
  primarily in the southern hemisphere. The binary merges into a black
  hole of mass 62-4+4M⊙ and spin 0.67-0.07+0.05. This black hole is
  significantly more massive than any other inferred from
  electromagnetic observations in the stellar-mass regime.
