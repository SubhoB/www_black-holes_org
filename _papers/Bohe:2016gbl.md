  We improve the accuracy of the effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms
  that were employed during the first observing run of Advanced LIGO
  for binaries of spinning, nonprecessing black holes by calibrating
  them to a set of 141 numerical-relativity (NR) waveforms. The NR
  simulations expand the domain of calibration toward larger mass
  ratios and spins, as compared to the previous EOBNR model. Merger-
  ringdown waveforms computed in black-hole perturbation theory for
  Kerr spins close to extremal provide additional inputs to the
  calibration. For the inspiral-plunge phase, we use a Markov-chain
  Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently explore the calibration space.
  For the merger-ringdown phase, we fit the NR signals with
  phenomenological formulae. After extrapolation of the calibrated
  model to arbitrary mass ratios and spins, the (dominant-mode) EOBNR
  waveforms have faithfulness—at design Advanced-LIGO
  sensitivity—above 99% against all the NR waveforms, including 16
  additional waveforms used for validation, when maximizing only on
  initial phase and time. This implies a negligible loss in event rate
  due to modeling for these binary configurations. We find that future
  NR simulations at mass ratios ≳4 and double spin ≳0.8 will be
  crucial to resolving discrepancies between different ways of
  extrapolating waveform models. We also find that some of the NR
  simulations that already exist in such region of parameter space are
  too short to constrain the low-frequency portion of the models.
  Finally, we build a reduced-order version of the EOBNR model to
  speed up waveform generation by orders of magnitude, thus enabling
  intensive data-analysis applications during the upcoming observation
  runs of Advanced LIGO.
