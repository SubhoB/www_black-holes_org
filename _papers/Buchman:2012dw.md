  This paper presents techniques and results for simulations of
  unequal mass, non-spinning black hole binaries with pseudo-spectral
  methods. Specifically, we develop an efficient root-finding
  procedure to ensure the black hole initial data have the desired
  masses and spins, we extend the dual coordinate frame method and
  eccentricity removal to asymmetric binaries. Furthermore, we
  describe techniques to simulate mergers of unequal mass black holes.
  The second part of the paper presents numerical simulations of non-
  spinning black hole binaries with mass ratios 2, 3, 4 and 6,
  covering between 15 and 22 orbits, merger and ringdown. We discuss
  the accuracy of these simulations, the evolution of the (initially
  zero) black hole spins, and the remnant black hole properties.
