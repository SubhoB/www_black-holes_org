  In many numerical implementations of the Cauchy formulation of
  Einstein's field equations one encounters artificial boundaries
  which raises the issue of specifying boundary conditions. Such
  conditions have to be chosen carefully. In particular, they should
  be compatible with the constraints, yield a well posed
  initial-boundary value formulation and incorporate some physically
  desirable properties like, for instance, minimizing reflections of
  gravitational radiation. Motivated by the problem in General
  Relativity, we analyze a model problem, consisting of a formulation
  of Maxwell's equations on a spatially compact region of spacetime
  with timelike boundaries. The form in which the equations are
  written is such that their structure is very similar to the
  Einstein-Christoffel symmetric hyperbolic formulations of Einstein's
  field equations. For this model problem, we specify a family of
  Sommerfeld-type constraint-preserving boundary conditions and show
  that the resulting initial-boundary value formulations are well
  posed. We expect that these results can be generalized to the
  Einstein-Christoffel formulations of General Relativity, at least in
  the case of linearizations about a stationary background.
