  We investigate the behavior of a dynamical scalar field on a fixed
  Kerr background in Kerr-Schild coordinates using a 3+1 dimensional
  spectral evolution code, and we measure the power-law tail decay
  that occurs at late times. We compare evolutions of initial data
  proportional to \(f(r) Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)\) where \(Y_{\ell
  m}\) is a spherical harmonic and \((r,\theta,\phi)\) are Kerr-Schild
  coordinates, to that of initial data proportional to \(f(r_{BL})
  Y_{\ell m}(\theta_{BL},\phi)\), where \((r_{BL},\theta_{BL})\) are
  Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We find that although these two cases
  are initially almost identical, the evolution can be quite different
  at intermediate times; however, at late times the power-law decay
  rates are equal.
