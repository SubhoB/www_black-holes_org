  A new constraint suppressing formulation of the Einstein evolution
  equations is presented, generalizing the five-parameter first-order
  system due to Kidder, Scheel and Teukolsky (KST). The auxiliary
  fields, introduced to make the KST system first-order, are given
  modified evolution equations designed to drive constraint violations
  toward zero. The algebraic structure of the new system is
  investigated, showing that the modifications preserve the
  hyperbolicity of the fundamental and constraint evolution
  equations. The evolution of the constraints for pertubations of flat
  spacetime is completely analyzed, and all finite-wavelength
  constraint modes are shown to decay exponentially when certain
  adjustable parameters satisfy appropriate inequalities. Numerical
  simulations of a single Schwarzschild black hole are presented,
  demonstrating the effectiveness of the new constraint-damping
  modifications.
