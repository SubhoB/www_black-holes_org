  We present a detailed study of the center-of-mass (c.m.) motion seen
  in simulations produced by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)
  collaboration. We investigate potential physical sources for the
  large c.m. motion in binary black hole simulations and find that a
  significant fraction of the c.m. motion cannot be explained
  physically, thus concluding that it is largely a gauge effect. These
  large c.m. displacements cause mode mixing in the gravitational
  waveform, most easily recognized as amplitude oscillations caused by
  the dominant (2,Â±2) modes mixing into subdominant modes. This mixing
  does not diminish with increasing distance from the source; it is
  present even in asymptotic waveforms, regardless of the method of
  data extraction. We describe the current c.m.-correction method used
  by the SXS collaboration, which is based on counteracting the motion
  of the c.m. as measured by the trajectories of the apparent horizons
  in the simulations, and investigate potential methods to improve
  that correction to the waveform. We also present a complementary
  method for computing an optimal c.m. correction or evaluating any
  other c.m. transformation based solely on the asymptotic waveform
  data.
