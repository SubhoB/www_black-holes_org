  Gravitational waves from the coalescence of two black holes carry
  the signature of the strong field dynamics of binary black holes. In
  this work we have used numerical relativity simulations and post-
  Newtonian theory to investigate this dynamics. Post-Newtonian theory
  is a low-velocity expansion that assumes the companion bodies to be
  point-particles, while numerical relativity treats black holes as
  extended objects with horizons and fully captures their dynamics.
  There is a priori no reason for the waveforms computed using these
  disparate methods to agree with each other, especially at late times
  when the black holes move close to the speed of light. We find,
  remarkably, that the leading order amplitudes in post-Newtonian
  theory agree well with the full general relativity solution for a
  large set of spherical harmonic modes, even in the most dynamical
  part of the binary evolution, with only some modes showing
  distinctly different behavior than that found by numerical
  relativity simulations. In particular, modes with spherical harmonic
  indices as well as are least modified from their dominant post-
  Newtonian behavior. Understanding the nature of these modes in terms
  of the post-Newtonian description will aid in formulating better
  models of the emitted waveforms in the strong field regime of the
  dynamics.
