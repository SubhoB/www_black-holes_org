  The conformal method for constructing initial data for Einstein's
  equations is presented in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
  picture (extrinsic curvature decomposition and conformal thin
  sandwich formalism, respectively), and advantages due to the recent
  introduction of a weight-function in the extrinsic curvature
  decomposition are discussed. I then describe recent progress in
  numerical techniques to solve the resulting elliptic equations, and
  explore innovative approaches toward the construction of
  astrophysically realistic initial data for binary black hole
  simulations.
