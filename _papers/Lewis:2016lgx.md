  Binary black holes which are both eccentric and undergo precession
  remain unexplored in numerical simulations. We present simulations
  of such systems which cover about 50 orbits at comparatively high
  mass ratios 5 and 7. The configurations correspond to the generic
  motion of a nonspinning body in a Kerr spacetime, and are chosen to
  study the transition from finite mass-ratio inspirals to point
  particle motion in Kerr. We develop techniques to extract analogs of
  the three fundamental frequencies of Kerr geodesics, compare our
  frequencies to those of Kerr, and show that the differences are
  consistent with self-force corrections entering at first order in
  mass ratio. This analysis also locates orbital resonances where the
  ratios of our frequencies take rational values. At the considered
  mass ratios, the binaries pass through resonances in one to two
  resonant cycles, and we find no discernible effects on the orbital
  evolution. We also compute the decay of eccentricity during the
  inspiral and find good agreement with the leading order post-
  Newtonian prediction.
