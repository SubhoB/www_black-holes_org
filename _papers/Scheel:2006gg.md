  A method is introduced for solving Einstein's equations using two
  distinct coordinate systems. The coordinate basis vectors associated
  with one system are used to project out components of the metric and
  other fields, in analogy with the way fields are projected onto an
  orthonormal tetrad basis. These field components are then determined
  as functions of a second independent coordinate system. The
  transformation to the second coordinate system can be thought of as
  a mapping from the original "inertial" coordinate system to the
  computational domain. This dual-coordinate method is used to perform
  stable numerical evolutions of a black-hole spacetime using the
  generalized harmonic form of Einstein's equations in coordinates
  that rotate with respect to the inertial frame at infinity; such
  evolutions are found to be generically unstable using a single
  rotating coordinate frame. The dual-coordinate method is also used
  here to evolve binary black-hole spacetimes for several orbits. The
  great flexibility of this method allows comoving coordinates to be
  adjusted with a feedback control system that keeps the excision
  boundaries of the holes within their respective apparent horizons.
