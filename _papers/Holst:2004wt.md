  Techniques are developed for projecting the solutions of symmetric
  hyperbolic evolution systems onto the constraint submanifold (the
  constraint-satisfying subset of the dynamical field space). These
  optimal projections map a field configuration to the "nearest"
  configuration in the constraint submanifold, where distances between
  configurations are measured with the natural metric on the space of
  dynamical fields. The construction and use of these projections is
  illustrated for a new representation of the scalar field equation
  that exhibits both bulk and boundary generated constraint
  violations. Numerical simulations on a black-hole background show
  that bulk constraint violations cannot be controlled by
  constraint-preserving boundary conditions alone, but are effectively
  controlled by constraint projection. Simulations also show that
  constraint violations entering through boundaries cannot be
  controlled by constraint projection alone, but are controlled by
  constraint-preserving boundary conditions. Numerical solutions to
  the pathological scalar field system are shown to converge to
  solutions of a standard representation of the scalar field equation
  when constraint projection and constraint-preserving boundary
  conditions are used together.
