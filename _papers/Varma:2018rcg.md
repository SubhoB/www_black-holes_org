  Binary black hole mergers are of great interest to the astrophysics
  community, not least because of their promise to test general
  relativity in the highly dynamic, strong field regime. Detections of
  gravitational waves from these sources by LIGO and Virgo have
  garnered widespread media and public attention. Among these sources,
  precessing systems (with misaligned black-hole spin/orbital angular
  momentum) are of particular interest because of the rich dynamics
  they offer. However, these systems are, in turn, more complex
  compared to nonprecessing systems, making them harder to model or
  develop intuition about. Visualizations of numerical simulations of
  precessing systems provide a means to understand and gain insights
  about these systems. However, since these simulations are very
  expensive, they can only be performed at a small number of points in
  parameter space. We present binaryBHexp, a tool that makes use of
  surrogate models of numerical simulations to generate on-the-fly
  interactive visualizations of precessing binary black holes. These
  visualizations can be generated in a few seconds, and at any point
  in the 7-dimensional parameter space of the underlying surrogate
  models. With illustrative examples, we demonstrate how this tool can
  be used to learn about precessing binary black hole systems.
