  We report a new critical solution found at the threshold of
  axisymmetric gravitational collapse of a complex scalar field with
  angular momentum. To carry angular momentum the scalar field cannot
  be axisymmetric; however, its azimuthal dependence is defined so
  that the resulting stress energy tensor and spacetime metric are
  axisymmetric. The critical solution found is non-spherical,
  discretely self-similar with an echoing exponent of 0.42 (± 4%), and
  exhibits a scaling exponent of 0.11 (± 10%) in near critical
  collapse. Our simulations suggest that the solution is universal
  (within the imposed symmetry class), modulo a family-dependent
  constant phase in the complex plane.
