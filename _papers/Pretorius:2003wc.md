  The use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques is crucial for
  accurate and efficient simulation of higher dimensional
  spacetimes. In this work we develop an adaptive algorithm tailored
  to the integration of finite difference discretizations of wave-like
  equations using characteristic coordinates. We demonstrate the
  algorithm by constructing a code implementing the
  Einstein-Klein-Gordon system of equations in spherical symmetry. We
  discuss how the algorithm can trivially be generalized to higher
  dimensional systems, and suggest a method that can be used to
  parallelize a characteristic code.
