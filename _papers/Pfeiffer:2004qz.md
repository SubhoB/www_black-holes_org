  A method is presented to construct initial data for Einstein's
  equations as a superposition of a gravitational wave perturbation on
  an arbitrary stationary background spacetime. The method combines
  the conformal thin sandwich formalism with linear gravitational
  waves, and allows detailed control over characteristics of the
  superposed gravitational wave like shape, location and propagation
  direction. It is furthermore fully covariant with respect to spatial
  coordinate changes and allows for very large amplitude of the
  gravitational wave.
