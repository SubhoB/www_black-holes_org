  At early times in numerical evolutions of binary black holes,
  current simulations contain an initial burst of spurious
  gravitational radiation (also called "junk radiation") which is not
  astrophysically realistic. The spurious radiation is a consequence
  of how the binary-black- hole initial data are constructed: the
  initial data are typically assumed to be conformally flat. In this
  paper, I adopt a curved conformal metric that is a superposition of
  two boosted, non- spinning black holes that are approximately 15
  orbits from merger. I compare junk radiation of the
  superposed-boosted-Schwarzschild (SBS) initial data with the junk of
  corresponding conformally flat, maximally sliced (CFMS) initial
  data. The SBS junk is smaller in amplitude than the CFMS junk, with
  the junk's leading-order spectral modes typically being reduced by a
  factor of order two or more.
