abstract: |
  A new representation of the Einstein evolution equations is
  presented that is first order, linearly degenerate, and symmetric
  hyperbolic. This new system uses the generalized harmonic method to
  specify the coordinates, and exponentially suppresses all small
  short-wavelength constraint violations. Physical and
  constraint-preserving boundary conditions are derived for this
  system, and numerical tests that demonstrate the effectiveness of
  the constraint suppression properties and the constraint-preserving
  boundary conditions are presented.
