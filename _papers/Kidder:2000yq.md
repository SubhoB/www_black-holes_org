  Current methods of evolving a spacetime containing one or more black
  holes are plagued by instabilities that prohibit long-term
  evolution. Some of these instabilities may be due to the numerical
  method used, traditionally finite differencing. In this paper, we
  explore the use of a pseudospectral collocation (PSC) method for the
  evolution of a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime in one
  dimension using a hyperbolic formulation of Einstein's equations. We
  demonstrate that our PSC method is able to evolve a spherically
  symmetric black hole spacetime forever without enforcing
  constraints, even if we add dynamics via a Klein-Gordon scalar
  field. We find that, in contrast to finite-differencing methods,
  black hole excision is a trivial operation using PSC applied to a
  hyperbolic formulation of Einstein's equations. We discuss the
  extension of this method to three spatial dimensions.
