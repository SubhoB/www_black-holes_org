  A first order symmetric hyperbolic tetrad formulation of the
  Einstein equations developed by Estabrook and Wahlquist and put into
  a form suitable for numerical relativity by Buchman and Bardeen (the
  WEBB formulation) is adapted to explicit spherical symmetry and
  tested for accuracy and stability in the evolution of spherically
  symmetric black holes (the Schwarzschild geometry). The lapse and
  shift which specify the evolution of the coordinates relative to the
  tetrad congruence are reset at frequent time intervals to keep the
  constant-time hypersurfaces nearly orthogonal to the tetrad
  congruence and the spatial coordinate satisfying a kind of minimal
  rate of strain condition. By arranging through initial conditions
  that the constant-time hypersurfaces are asymptotically hyperbolic,
  we simplify the boundary value problem and improve stability of the
  evolution. Results are obtained for both tetrad gauges ("Nester" and
  "Lorentz") of the WEBB formalism using finite difference numerical
  methods. We are able to obtain stable unconstrained evolution with
  the Nester gauge for certain initial conditions, but not with the
  Lorentz gauge.
