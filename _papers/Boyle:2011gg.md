  We discuss a geometrical method to define a preferred reference
  frame for precessing binary systems and the gravitational waves they
  emit. This minimal-rotation frame is aligned with the
  angular-momentum axis and fixes the rotation about that axis up to a
  constant angle, resulting in an essentially invariant
  frame. Gravitational waveforms decomposed in this frame are
  similarly invariant under rotations of the inertial frame and
  exhibit relatively smoothly varying phase. By contrast, earlier
  prescriptions for radiation-aligned frames induce extraneous
  features in the gravitational-wave phase which depend on the
  orientation of the inertial frame, leading to fluctuations in the
  frequency that may compound to many gravitational-wave cycles. We
  explore a simplified description of post-Newtonian approximations
  for precessing systems using the minimal-rotation frame, and
  describe the construction of analytical/numerical hybrid waveforms
  for such systems.
