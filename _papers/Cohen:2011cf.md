  We examine the structure of the event horizon for numerical
  simulations of two black holes that begin in a quasicircular orbit,
  inspiral, and finally merge. We find that the spatial cross section
  of the merged event horizon has spherical topology (to the limit of
  our resolution), despite the expectation that generic binary black
  hole mergers in the absence of symmetries should result in an event
  horizon that briefly has a toroidal cross section. Using insight
  gained from our numerical simulations, we investigate how the choice
  of time slicing affects both the spatial cross section of the event
  horizon and the locus of points at which generators of the event
  horizon cross. To ensure the robustness of our conclusions, our
  results are checked at multiple numerical resolutions. 3D
  visualization data for these resolutions are available for public
  access online. We find that the structure of the horizon generators
  in our simulations is consistent with expectations, and the lack of
  toroidal horizons in our simulations is due to our choice of time
  slicing.
