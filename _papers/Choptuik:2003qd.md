  Black strings, one class of higher dimensional analogues of black
  holes, were shown to be unstable to long wavelength perturbations by
  Gregory and Laflamme in 1992, via a linear analysis. We revisit the
  problem through numerical solution of the full equations of motion,
  and focus on trying to determine the end-state of a perturbed,
  unstable black string. Our preliminary results show that such a
  spacetime tends towards a solution resembling a sequence of
  spherical black holes connected by thin black strings, at least at
  intermediate times. However, our code fails then, primarily due to
  large gradients that develop in metric functions, as the coordinate
  system we use is not well adapted to the nature of the unfolding
  solution. We are thus unable to determine how close the solution we
  see is to the final end-state, though we do observe rich dynamical
  behavior of the system in the intermediate stages.
