  For highly compact neutron stars, constructing numerical initial
  data for black hole-neutron star binary evolutions is very
  difficult. We describe improvements to an earlier method that enable
  it to handle these more challenging cases. We examine the case of a
  6:1 mass ratio system in inspiral close to merger, where the star is
  governed by a polytropic \(\Gamma=2\), an SLy, or an LS220 equation
  of state. In particular, we are able to obtain a solution with a
  realistic LS220 equation of state for a star with compactness 0.26
  and mass 1.98 \(M_\odot\), which is representative of the highest
  reliably determined neutron star masses. For the SLy equation of
  state, we can obtain solutions with a comparable compactness of
  0.25, while for a family of polytropic equations of state, we obtain
  solutions with compactness up to 0.21, the largest compactness that
  is stable in this family. These compactness values are significantly
  higher than any previously published results. We find that
  improvements in adapting the computational domain to the neutron
  star surface and in accounting for the center of mass drift of the
  system are the key ingredients allowing us to obtain these
  solutions.
