  Gravitational-wave data is gauge dependent. While we can restrict
  the class of gauges in which such data may be expressed, there will
  still be an infinite-dimensional group of transformations allowed
  while remaining in this class, and almost as many different—though
  physically equivalent—waveforms as there are transformations. This
  paper presents a method for calculating the effects of the most
  important transformation group, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group,
  consisting of rotations, boosts, and supertranslations (which
  include time and space translations as special cases). To a
  reasonable approximation, these transformations result in simple
  coupling between the modes in a spin-weighted spherical-harmonic
  decomposition of the waveform. It is shown that waveforms from
  simulated compact binaries in the publicly available SXS waveform
  catalog contain unmodeled effects due to displacement and drift of
  the center of mass, accounting for mode mixing at typical levels of
  1%. However, these effects can be mitigated by measuring the average
  motion of the system’s center of mass for a portion of the inspiral,
  and applying the opposite transformation to the waveform data. More
  generally, controlling the BMS transformations will be necessary to
  eliminate the gauge ambiguity inherent in gravitational-wave data
  for both numerical and analytical waveforms. Open-source code
  implementing BMS transformations of waveforms is supplied along with
  this paper in the supplemental materials.
