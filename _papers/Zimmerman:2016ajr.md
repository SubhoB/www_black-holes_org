  The redshift factor z is an invariant quantity of fundamental
  interest in post-Newtonian and self-force descriptions of compact
  binaries. It connects different approximation schemes, and plays a
  central role in the first law of binary black hole mechanics, which
  links local quantities to asymptotic measures of energy and angular
  momentum in these systems. Through this law, the redshift factor is
  conjectured to have a close relation to the surface gravity of the
  event horizons of black holes in circular orbits. We propose and
  implement a novel method for extracting the redshift factor on
  apparent horizons in numerical simulations of quasicircular binary
  inspirals. Our results confirm the conjectured relationship between
  z and the surface gravity of the holes and that the first law holds
  to a remarkable degree for binary inspirals. The redshift factor
  enables tests of analytic predictions for z in spacetimes where the
  binary is only approximately circular, giving a new connection
  between analytic approximations and numerical simulations.
