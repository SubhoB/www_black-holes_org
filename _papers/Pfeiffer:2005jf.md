  The conformal thin sandwich (CTS) equations are a set of four of the
  Einstein equations, which generalize the Laplace-Poisson equation of
  Newton's theory. We examine numerically solutions of the CTS
  equations describing perturbed Minkowski space, and find only one
  solution. However, we find <em>two</em> distinct solutions, one even
  containing a black hole, when the lapse is determined by a fifth
  elliptic equation through specification of the mean curvature. While
  the relationship of the two systems and their solutions is a
  fundamental property of general relativity, this fairly simple
  example of an elliptic system with non-unique solutions is also of
  broader interest.
