  During the merger of a black hole and a neutron star, baryonic mass
  can become unbound from the system. Because the ejected material is
  extremely neutron-rich, the r-process rapidly synthesizes heavy
  nuclides as the material expands and cools. In this work, we map
  general relativistic models of black hole–neutron star mergers into
  a Newtonian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code and follow
  the evolution of the thermodynamics and morphology of the ejecta
  until the outflows become homologous. We investigate how the
  subsequent evolution depends on our mapping procedure and find that
  the results are robust. Using thermodynamic histories from the SPH
  particles, we then calculate the expected nucleosynthesis in these
  outflows while varying the level of neutrino irradiation coming from
  the post-merger accretion disc. We find that the ejected material
  robustly produces r-process nucleosynthesis even for unrealistically
  high neutrino luminosities, due to the rapid velocities of the
  outflow. None the less, we find that neutrinos can have an impact on
  the detailed pattern of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Electron
  neutrinos are captured by neutrons to produce protons while neutron
  capture is occurring. The produced protons rapidly form low-mass
  seed nuclei for the r-process. These low-mass seeds are eventually
  incorporated into the first r-process peak at A ∼ 78. We consider
  the mechanism of this process in detail and discuss if it can impact
  galactic chemical evolution of the first peak r-process nuclei.
