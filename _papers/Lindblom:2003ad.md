  The Einstein evolution equations have been written in a number of
  symmetric hyperbolic forms when the gauge fields--the densitized
  lapse and the shift--are taken to be fixed functions of the
  coordinates. Extended systems of evolution equations are constructed
  here by adding the gauge degrees of freedom to the set of dynamical
  fields, thus forming symmetric hyperbolic systems for the combined
  evolution of the gravitational and the gauge fields. The associated
  characteristic speeds can be made causal (i.e. less than or equal to
  the speed of light) by adjusting 14 free parameters in these new
  systems. And 21 additional free parameters are available, for
  example to optimize the stability of numerical evolutions. The gauge
  evolution equations in these systems are generalizations of the
  "K-driver" and "Gamma-driver" conditions that have been used with
  some success in numerical black hole evolutions.
