  In this Comment we compute the contributions of the radiation
  reaction force in the 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational wave
  polarizations for compact binaries in circular orbits. (i) We point
  out and correct an inconsistency in the derivation of Arun,
  Blanchet, Iyer, and Qusailah. (ii) We prove that all contributions
  from radiation reaction in the 2.5PN waveform are actually
  negligible since they can be absorbed into a modification of the
  orbital phase at the 5PN order.
