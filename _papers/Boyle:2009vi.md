  Two complementary techniques are developed for obtaining the
  asymptotic form of gravitational-wave data at large radii from
  numerical simulations, in the form of easily implemented algorithms.
  It is shown that, without extrapolation, near-field effects produce
  errors in extracted waveforms that can significantly affect LIGO
  data analysis. The extrapolation techniques are discussed in the
  context of Newman-Penrose data applied to extrapolation of waveforms
  from an equal-mass, nonspinning black-hole binary simulation. The
  results of the two methods are shown to agree within error
  estimates. The various benefits and deficiencies of the methods are
  discussed.
