  We present the first numerical-relativity simulation of a compact-
  object binary whose gravitational waveform is long enough to cover
  the entire frequency band of advanced gravitational-wave detectors,
  such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, for mass ratio 7 and total mass as
  low as 45.5M⊙. We find that effective-one-body models, either
  uncalibrated or calibrated against substantially shorter numerical-
  relativity waveforms at smaller mass ratios, reproduce our new
  waveform remarkably well, with a negligible loss in detection rate
  due to modeling error. In contrast, post-Newtonian inspiral
  waveforms and existing calibrated phenomenological inspiral-merger-
  ringdown waveforms display greater disagreement with our new
  simulation. The disagreement varies substantially depending on the
  specific post-Newtonian approximant used.
