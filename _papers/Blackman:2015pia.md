abstract: |
  Simulating a binary black hole coalescence by solving Einstein’s
  equations is computationally expensive, requiring days to months of
  supercomputing time. Using reduced order modeling techniques, we
  construct an accurate surrogate model, which is evaluated in a
  millisecond to a second, for numerical relativity (NR) waveforms
  from nonspinning binary black hole coalescences with mass ratios in
  [1, 10] and durations corresponding to about 15 orbits before
  merger. We assess the model’s uncertainty and show that our modeling
  strategy predicts NR waveforms not used for the surrogate’s training
  with errors nearly as small as the numerical error of the NR code.
  Our model includes all spherical-harmonic Yℓm−2 waveform modes
  resolved by the NR code up to ℓ=8. We compare our surrogate model to
  effective one body waveforms from 50M⊙ to 300M⊙ for advanced LIGO
  detectors and find that the surrogate is always more faithful (by at
  least an order of magnitude in most cases).
