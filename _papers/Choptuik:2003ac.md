  We present results from a numerical study of critical gravitational
  collapse of axisymmetric distributions of massless scalar field
  energy. We find threshold behavior that can be described by the
  spherically symmetric critical solution with axisymmetric
  perturbations. However, we see indications of a growing,
  non-spherical mode about the spherically symmetric critical
  solution. The effect of this instability is that the small asymmetry
  present in what would otherwise be a spherically symmetric
  self-similar solution grows. This growth continues until a
  bifurcation occurs and two distinct regions form on the axis, each
  resembling the spherically symmetric self-similar solution. The
  existence of a non-spherical unstable mode is in conflict with
  previous perturbative results, and we therefore discuss whether such
  a mode exists in the continuum limit, or whether we are instead
  seeing a marginally stable mode that is rendered unstable by
  numerical approximation.
