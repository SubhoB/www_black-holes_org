  The Einstein initial-value equations in the extrinsic curvature
  (Hamiltonian) representation and conformal thin sandwich
  (Lagrangian) representation are brought into complete conformity by
  the use of a decomposition of symmetric tensors which involves a
  weight function. In stationary spacetimes, there is a natural choice
  of the weight function such that the transverse traceless part of
  the extrinsic curvature (or canonical momentum) vanishes.
