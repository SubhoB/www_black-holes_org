  Binary black-hole systems are expected to be important sources of
  gravitational waves for upcoming gravitational-wave detectors. If
  the spins are not colinear with each other or with the orbital
  angular momentum, these systems exhibit complicated precession
  dynamics that are imprinted on the gravitational waveform. We
  develop a new procedure to match the precession dynamics computed by
  post-Newtonian (PN) theory to those of numerical binary black-hole
  simulations in full general relativity. For numerical relativity
  (NR) simulations lasting approximately two precession cycles, we
  find that the PN and NR predictions for the directions of the
  orbital angular momentum and the spins agree to better than ∼1° with
  NR during the inspiral, increasing to 5° near merger. Nutation of
  the orbital plane on the orbital time scale agrees well between NR
  and PN, whereas nutation of the spin direction shows qualitatively
  different behavior in PN and NR. We also examine how the PN
  equations for precession and orbital-phase evolution converge with
  PN order, and we quantify the impact of various choices for handling
  partially known PN terms.
