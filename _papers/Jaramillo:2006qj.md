  We study the numerical implementation of a set of boundary
  conditions derived from the isolated horizon formalism, and which
  characterize a black hole whose horizon is in
  quasi-equilibrium. More precisely, we enforce these geometrical
  prescriptions as inner boundary conditions on an excised sphere, in
  the numerical resolution of the Conformal Thin Sandwich
  equations. As main results, we firstly establish the consistency of
  including in the set of boundary conditions a "constant surface
  gravity" prescription, interpretable as a lapse boundary condition,
  and secondly we assess how the prescriptions presented recently by
  Dain et al. for guaranteeing the well-posedness of the Conformal
  Transverse Traceless equations with quasi-equilibrium horizon
  conditions extend to the Conformal Thin Sandwich elliptic system. As
  a consequence of the latter analysis, we discuss the freedom of
  prescribing the expansion associated with the ingoing null normal at
  the horizon.
