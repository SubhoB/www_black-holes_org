  The detection of gravitational waves and the extraction of physical
  information from them requires the prediction of accurate waveforms
  to be used in template banks. For that purpose, the accuracy of
  effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms has been improved over the last
  years by calibrating them to numerical-relativity (NR) waveforms. So
  far, the calibration has employed a handful of NR waveforms with a
  total length of ~30 cycles, the length being limited by the
  computational cost of NR simulations. Here we address the
  outstanding problem of the stability of the EOB calibration with
  respect to the length of NR waveforms. Performing calibration
  studies against NR waveforms of nonspinning black-hole binaries with
  mass ratios 1, 1.5, 5, and 8, and with a total length of ~60 cycles,
  we find that EOB waveforms calibrated against either 30 or 60 cycles
  will be indistinguishable by the advanced detectors LIGO and Virgo
  when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is below 110. When
  extrapolating to a very large number of cycles, using very
  conservative assumptions, we can conclude that state-of-the-art
  nonspinning EOB waveforms of any length are sufficiently accurate
  for parameter estimation with advanced detectors when the SNR is
  below 20, the mass ratio is below 5 and total mass is above 20
  Msun. The results are not conclusive for the entire parameter space
  because of current NR errors.
