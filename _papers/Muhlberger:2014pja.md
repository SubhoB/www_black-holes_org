  Dynamical instabilities in protoneutron stars may produce
  gravitational waves whose observation could shed light on the
  physics of core-collapse supernovae. When born with sufficient
  differential rotation, these stars are susceptible to a shear
  instability (the "low-T/|W| instability"), but such rotation can
  also amplify magnetic fields to strengths where they have a
  considerable impact on the dynamics of the stellar matter. Using a
  new magnetohydrodynamics module for the Spectral Einstein Code, we
  have simulated a differentially-rotating neutron star in full 3D to
  study the effects of magnetic fields on this instability. Though
  strong toroidal fields were predicted to suppress the low-T/|W|
  instability, we find that they do so only in a small range of field
  strengths. Below 4e13 G, poloidal seed fields do not wind up fast
  enough to have an effect before the instability saturates, while
  above 5e14 G, magnetic instabilities can actually amplify a global
  quadrupole mode (this threshold may be even lower in reality, as
  small-scale magnetic instabilities remain difficult to resolve
  numerically). Thus, the prospects for observing gravitational waves
  from such systems are not in fact diminished over most of the
  magnetic parameter space. Additionally, we report that the detailed
  development of the low-T/|W| instability, including its growth rate,
  depends strongly on the particular numerical methods used. The
  high-order methods we employ suggest that growth might be
  considerably slower than found in some previous simulations.
