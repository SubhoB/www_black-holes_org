  We present a new many-parameter family of hyperbolic representations
  of Einstein's equations, which we obtain by a straightforward
  generalization of previously known systems. We solve the resulting
  evolution equations numerically for a Schwarzschild black hole in
  three spatial dimensions, and find that the stability of the
  simulation is strongly dependent on the form of the equations
  (i.e. the choice of parameters of the hyperbolic system),
  independent of the numerics. For an appropriate range of parameters
  we can evolve a single 3D black hole to \(t \simeq 600 M\) -- \(1300
  M\), and are apparently limited by constraint-violating solutions of
  the evolution equations. We expect that our method should result in
  comparable times for evolutions of a binary black hole system.
