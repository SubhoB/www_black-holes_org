  We present a code to construct initial data for binary neutron star
  systems in which the stars are rotating. Our code, based on a
  formalism developed by Tichy, allows for arbitrary rotation axes of
  the neutron stars and is able to achieve rotation rates near
  rotational breakup. We compute the neutron star angular momentum
  through quasilocal angular momentum integrals. When constructing
  irrotational binary neutron stars, we find a very small residual
  dimensionless spin of ∼2×10-4. Evolutions of rotating neutron star
  binaries show that the magnitude of the stars’ angular momentum is
  conserved, and that the spin and orbit precession of the stars is
  well described by post-Newtonian approximation. We demonstrate that
  orbital eccentricity of the binary neutron stars can be controlled
  to ∼0.1%. The neutron stars show quasinormal mode oscillations at an
  amplitude which increases with the rotation rate of the stars.
