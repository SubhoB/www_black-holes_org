  Black hole–neutron star (BHNS) binaries are important sources of
  gravitational waves for second-generation interferometers, and BHNS
  mergers are also a proposed engine for short, hard gamma-ray bursts.
  The behavior of both the spacetime (and thus the emitted
  gravitational waves) and the neutron-star matter in a BHNS merger
  depend strongly and nonlinearly on the black hole's spin. While
  there is a significant possibility that astrophysical black holes
  could have spins that are nearly extremal (i.e. near the theoretical
  maximum), to date fully relativistic simulations of BHNS binaries
  have included black-hole spins only up to S/M2 = 0.9, which
  corresponds to the black hole having approximately half as much
  rotational energy as possible, given the black hole's mass. In this
  paper, we present a new simulation of a BHNS binary with a mass
  ratio q = 3 and black-hole spin S/M2 = 0.97, the highest simulated
  to date. We find that the black hole's large spin leads to the most
  massive accretion disc and the largest tidal tail outflow of any
  fully relativistic BHNS simulations to date, even exceeding the
  results implied by extrapolating results from simulations with lower
  black-hole spin. The disc appears to be remarkably stable. We also
  find that the high black-hole spin persists until shortly before the
  time of merger; afterward, both merger and accretion spin down the
  black hole.
