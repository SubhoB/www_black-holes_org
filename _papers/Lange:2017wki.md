  We present and assess a Bayesian method to interpret gravitational
  wave signals from binary black holes. Our method directly compares
  gravitational wave data to numerical relativity (NR) simulations. In
  this study, we present a detailed investigation of the systematic
  and statistical parameter estimation errors of this method. This
  procedure bypasses approximations used in semianalytical models for
  compact binary coalescence. In this work, we use the full posterior
  parameter distribution for only generic nonprecessing binaries,
  drawing inferences away from the set of NR simulations used, via
  interpolation of a single scalar quantity (the marginalized log
  likelihood, lnL) evaluated by comparing data to nonprecessing binary
  black hole simulations. We also compare the data to generic
  simulations, and discuss the effectiveness of this procedure for
  generic sources. We specifically assess the impact of higher order
  modes, repeating our interpretation with both l≤2 as well as l≤3
  harmonic modes. Using the l≤3 higher modes, we gain more information
  from the signal and can better constrain the parameters of the
  gravitational wave signal. We assess and quantify several sources of
  systematic error that our procedure could introduce, including
  simulation resolution and duration; most are negligible. We show
  through examples that our method can recover the parameters for
  equal mass, zero spin, GW150914-like, and unequal mass, precessing
  spin sources. Our study of this new parameter estimation method
  demonstrates that we can quantify and understand the systematic and
  statistical error. This method allows us to use higher order modes
  from numerical relativity simulations to better constrain the black
  hole binary parameters.
