  Motivated by the need to control the exponential growth of
  constraint violations in numerical solutions of the Einstein
  evolution equations, two methods are studied here for controlling
  this growth in general hyperbolic evolution systems. The first
  method adjusts the evolution equations dynamically, by adding
  multiples of the constraints, in a way designed to minimize this
  growth. The second method imposes special constraint preserving
  boundary conditions on the incoming components of the dynamical
  fields. The efficacy of these methods is tested by using them to
  control the growth of constraints in fully dynamical 3D numerical
  solutions of a particular representation of the Maxwell equations
  that is subject to constraint violations. The constraint preserving
  boundary conditions are found to be much more effective than active
  constraint control in the case of this Maxwell system.
