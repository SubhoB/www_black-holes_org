  Simulations of neutron star–black hole (NSBH) binaries generally
  consider black holes with masses in the range (5–10)M⊙, where we
  expect to find most stellar mass black holes. The existence of lower
  mass black holes, however, cannot be theoretically ruled out. Low-
  mass black holes in binary systems with a neutron star companion
  could mimic neutron star–neutron star (NSNS) binaries, as they power
  similar gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. To
  understand the differences and similarities between NSNS mergers and
  low-mass NSBH mergers, numerical simulations are required. Here, we
  perform a set of simulations of low-mass NSBH mergers, including
  systems compatible with GW170817. Our simulations use a composition
  and temperature dependent equation of state (DD2) and approximate
  neutrino transport, but no magnetic fields. We find that low-mass
  NSBH mergers produce remnant disks significantly less massive than
  previously expected, and consistent with the postmerger outflow mass
  inferred from GW170817 for a moderately asymmetric mass ratio.
  Whether postmerger disk outflows can also explain the inferred
  velocity and composition of that event’s ejecta is an open question
  that our merger simulations cannot answer at this point. The
  dynamical ejecta produced by systems compatible with GW170817 are
  negligible except if the mass ratio and black hole spin are at the
  edge of the allowed parameter space. The dynamical ejecta are cold,
  neutron-rich, and surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the
  tidal disruption of a neutron star: v∼(0.1–0.15)c. We also find that
  the final mass of the remnant black hole is consistent with existing
  analytical predictions, while the final spin of that black hole is
  noticeably larger than expected—up to χBH=0.84 for our equal mass
  case.
