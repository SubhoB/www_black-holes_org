  We study the appearance of multiple solutions to certain
  decompositions of Einstein's constraint equations. Pfeiffer and York
  recently reported the existence of two branches of solutions for
  identical background data in the extended conformal thin-sandwich
  decomposition. We show that the Hamiltonian constraint alone, when
  expressed in a certain way, admits two branches of solutions with
  properties very similar to those found by Pfeiffer and York. We
  construct these two branches analytically for a constant-density
  star in spherical symmetry, but argue that this behavior is more
  general. In the case of the Hamiltonian constraint this
  non-uniqueness is well known to be related to the sign of one
  particular term, and we argue that the extended conformal
  thin-sandwich equations contain a similar term that causes the
  breakdown of uniqueness.
