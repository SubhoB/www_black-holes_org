  Neutron star-black hole binaries are among the strongest sources of
  gravitational waves detectable by current observatories. They can
  also power bright electromagnetic signals (gamma-ray bursts,
  kilonovae), and may be a significant source of production of
  r-process nuclei. A misalignment of the black hole spin with respect
  to the orbital angular momentum leads to precession of that spin and
  of the orbital plane, and has a significant effect on the properties
  of the post-merger remnant and of the material ejected by the
  merger. We present a first set of simulations of precessing neutron
  star-black hole mergers using a hot, composition dependent, nuclear-
  theory based equation of state (DD2). We show that the mass of the
  remnant and of the dynamical ejecta are broadly consistent with the
  result of simulations using simpler equations of state, while
  differences arise when considering the dynamics of the merger and
  the velocity of the ejecta. We show that the latter can easily be
  understood from assumptions about the composition of low-density,
  cold material in the different equations of state, and propose an
  updated estimate for the ejecta velocity which takes those effects
  into account. We also present an updated mesh-refinement algorithm
  which allows us to improve the numerical resolution used to evolve
  neutron star-black hole mergers.
