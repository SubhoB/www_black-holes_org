  Binary black hole simulations with black hole excision using
  spectral methods require a coordinate transformation into a
  corotating coordinate system where the black holes are essentially
  at rest. This paper presents and discusses two coordinate
  transformations that are applicable to precessing binary systems,
  one based on Euler angles, the other on quaternions. Both approaches
  are found to work well for binaries with moderate precession, i.e.,
  for cases where the orientation of the orbital plane changes by
  ≪90°. For strong precession, performance of the Euler-angle
  parametrization deteriorates, eventually failing for a 90° change in
  orientation because of singularities in the parametrization (“gimbal
  lock”). In contrast, the quaternion representation is invariant
  under an overall rotation and handles any orientation of the orbital
  plane as well as the Euler-angle technique handles nonprecessing
  binaries.
