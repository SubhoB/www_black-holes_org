  We discuss the initial value problem of general relativity in its
  recently unified Lagrangian and Hamiltonian pictures and present a
  multi-domain pseudo-spectral collocation method to solve the
  resulting coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Using
  this code, we explore several approaches to construct initial data
  sets containing one or two black holes: We compute quasi-circular
  orbits for spinning equal mass black holes and unequal mass
  (nonspinning) black holes using the effective potential method with
  Bowen-York extrinsic curvature. We compare initial data sets
  resulting from different decompositions, and from different choices
  of the conformal metric with each other. Furthermore, we use the
  quasi-equilibrium method to construct initial data for single black
  holes and for binary black holes in quasi-circular orbits. We
  investigate these binary black hole data sets and examine the limits
  of large mass-ratio and wide separation. Finally, we propose a new
  method for constructing spacetimes with superposed gravitational
  waves of possibly very large amplitude.
