  We describe a general procedure to generate spinning, precessing
  waveforms that include inspiral, merger and ringdown stages in the
  effective-one-body (EOB) approach. The procedure uses a precessing
  frame in which precession-induced amplitude and phase modulations
  are minimized, and an inertial frame, aligned with the spin of the
  final black hole, in which we carry out the matching of the
  inspiral-plunge to merger-ringdown waveforms. As a first
  application, we build spinning, precessing EOB waveforms for the
  gravitational modes l=2 such that in the nonprecessing limit those
  waveforms agree with the EOB waveforms recently calibrated to
  numerical-relativity waveforms. Without recalibrating the EOB model,
  we then compare EOB and post-Newtonian precessing waveforms to two
  numerical-relativity waveforms produced by the Caltech-Cornell-CITA
  collaboration. The numerical waveforms are strongly precessing and
  have 35 and 65 gravitational-wave cycles. We find a remarkable
  agreement between EOB and numerical-relativity precessing waveforms
  and spins' evolutions. The phase difference is ~ 0.2 rad at merger,
  while the mismatches, computed using the advanced-LIGO noise
  spectral density, are below 2% when maximizing only on the time and
  phase at coalescence and on the polarization angle.
