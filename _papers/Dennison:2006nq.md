  We construct approximate analytical solutions to the constraint
  equations of general relativity for binary black holes of arbitrary
  mass ratio in quasicircular orbit. We adopt the puncture method of
  Brandt and Bruegmann to solve the constraint equations in the
  transverse-traceless decomposition and consider perturbations of
  Schwarzschild black holes caused by boosts and the presence of a
  binary companion. A superposition of these two perturbations then
  yields approximate, but fully analytic binary black hole initial
  data that are accurate to first order in the inverse of the binary
  separation and the square of the black holes' momenta. Even close to
  the innermost stable circular orbit, the perturbative treatment
  introduces errors that are remarkably small and only somewhat larger
  than the errors caused by the underlying assumptions of puncture
  data.
