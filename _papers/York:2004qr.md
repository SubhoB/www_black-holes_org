  The complete form of the constraints following from their conformal
  structure is extended so as to include constant mean curvature and
  other mean curvature foliations. This step is demonstrated using the
  momentum phase space approach. This approach yields equations of
  exactly the same form as the extended conformal thin sandwich
  approach. In solving the equations, it is never necessary actually
  to perform a tensor decomposition.
