  The behavior of merging black holes (including the emitted
  gravitational waves and the properties of the remnant) can currently
  be computed only by numerical simulations. This paper introduces ten
  numerical relativity simulations of binary black holes with equal
  masses and equal spins aligned or antialigned with the orbital
  angular momentum. The initial spin magnitudes have |χi|≲0.95 and are
  more concentrated in the aligned direction because of the greater
  astrophysical interest of this case. We combine these data with five
  previously reported simulations of the same configuration, but with
  different spin magnitudes, including the highest spin simulated to
  date, χi≈0.97. This data set is sufficiently accurate to enable us
  to offer improved analytic fitting formulas for the final spin and
  for the energy radiated by gravitational waves as a function of
  initial spin. The improved fitting formulas can help to improve our
  understanding of the properties of binary black hole merger remnants
  and can be used to enhance future approximate waveforms for
  gravitational wave searches, such as effective-one-body waveforms.
