  We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by
  the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal,
  GW151226, was observed by the twin detectors of the Laser
  Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) on December 26,
  2015 at 03:38:53 UTC. The signal was initially identified within 70
  s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences.
  Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a network
  signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5σ. The
  signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s,
  increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35
  to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of
  3.4+0.7−0.9×10−22. The inferred source-frame initial black hole
  masses are 14.2+8.3−3.7M⊙ and 7.5+2.3−2.3M⊙, and the final black
  hole mass is 20.8+6.1−1.7M⊙. We find that at least one of the
  component black holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is
  located at a luminosity distance of 440+180−190  Mpc corresponding
  to a redshift of 0.09+0.03−0.04. All uncertainties define a 90%
  credible interval. This second gravitational-wave observation
  provides improved constraints on stellar populations and on
  deviations from general relativity.
