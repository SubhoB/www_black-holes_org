  We first use five non-spinning and two mildly spinning (chi_i \simeq
  -0.44, +0.44) numerical-relativity waveforms of black-hole binaries
  and calibrate an effective-one-body (EOB) model for non-precessing
  spinning binaries, notably its dynamics and the dominant (2,2)
  gravitational-wave mode. Then, we combine the above results with
  recent outcomes of small-mass-ratio simulations produced by the
  Teukolsky equation and build a prototype EOB model for detection
  purposes, which is capable of generating inspiral-merger-ringdown
  waveforms for non-precessing spinning black-hole binaries with any
  mass ratio and individual black-hole spins -1 \leq chi_i \lesssim
  0.7. We compare the prototype EOB model to two equal-mass highly
  spinning numerical-relativity waveforms of black holes with spins
  chi_i = -0.95, +0.97, which were not available at the time the EOB
  model was calibrated. In the case of Advanced LIGO we find that the
  mismatch between prototype-EOB and numerical-relativity waveforms is
  always smaller than 0.003 for total mass 20-200 M_\odot, the
  mismatch being computed by maximizing only over the initial phase
  and time. To successfully generate merger waveforms for individual
  black-hole spins chi_i \gtrsim 0.7, the prototype-EOB model needs to
  be improved by (i) better modeling the plunge dynamics and (ii)
  including higher-order PN spin terms in the gravitational-wave modes
  and radiation-reaction force.
