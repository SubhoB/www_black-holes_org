  Outer boundary conditions for strongly and symmetric hyperbolic
  formulations of 3D Einstein's field equations with a live gauge
  condition are discussed. The boundary conditions have the property
  that they ensure constraint propagation and control in a sense made
  precise in this article the physical degrees of freedom at the
  boundary. We use Fourier-Laplace transformation techniques to find
  necessary conditions for the well posedness of the resulting
  initial-boundary value problem and integrate the resulting
  three-dimensional nonlinear equations using a finite-differencing
  code. We obtain a set of constraint-preserving boundary conditions
  which pass a robust numerical stability test. We explicitly compare
  these new boundary conditions to standard, maximally dissipative
  ones through Brill wave evolutions. Our numerical results explicitly
  show that in the latter case the constraint variables, describing
  the violation of the constraints, do not converge to zero when
  resolution is increased while for the new boundary conditions, the
  constraint variables do decrease as resolution is increased. As an
  application, we inject pulses of "gravitational radiation" through
  the boundaries of an initially flat spacetime domain, with enough
  amplitude to generate strong fields and induce large curvature
  scalars, showing that our boundary conditions are robust enough to
  handle nonlinear dynamics. We expect our boundary conditions to be
  useful for improving the accuracy and stability of current binary
  black hole and binary neutron star simulations, for a successful
  implementation of characteristic or perturbative matching
  techniques, and other applications. We also discuss limitations of
  our approach and possible future directions.
