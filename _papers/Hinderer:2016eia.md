abstract: |
  Extracting the unique information on ultradense nuclear matter from
  the gravitational waves emitted by merging neutron-star binaries
  requires robust theoretical models of the signal. We develop a novel
  effective-one-body waveform model that includes, for the first time,
  dynamic (instead of only adiabatic) tides of the neutron star as
  well as the merger signal for neutron-star–black-hole binaries. We
  demonstrate the importance of the dynamic tides by comparing our
  model against new numerical-relativity simulations of nonspinning
  neutron-star–black-hole binaries spanning more than 24
  gravitational-wave cycles, and to other existing numerical
  simulations for double neutron-star systems. Furthermore, we derive
  an effective description that makes explicit the dependence of
  matter effects on two key parameters: tidal deformability and
  fundamental oscillation frequency.
