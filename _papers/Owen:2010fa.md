  When one splits spacetime into space plus time, the spacetime
  curvature (Weyl tensor) gets split into an "electric" part E_{jk}
  that describes tidal gravity and a "magnetic" part B_{jk} that
  describes differential dragging of inertial frames. We introduce
  tools for visualizing B_{jk} (frame-drag vortex lines, their
  vorticity, and vortexes) and E_{jk} (tidal tendex lines, their
  tendicity, and tendexes), and also visualizations of a black-hole
  horizon's (scalar) vorticity and tendicity. We use these tools to
  elucidate the nonlinear dynamics of curved spacetime in merging
  black-hole binaries.
