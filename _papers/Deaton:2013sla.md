  Neutrino emission significantly affects the evolution of the
  accretion tori formed in black hole-neutron star mergers. It removes
  energy from the disk, alters its composition, and provides a
  potential power source for a gamma-ray burst. To study these
  effects, simulations in general relativity with a hot microphysical
  equation of state (EOS) and neutrino feedback are needed. We present
  the first such simulation, using a neutrino leakage scheme for
  cooling to capture the most essential effects and considering a
  moderate mass (1.4 M☉ neutron star, 5.6 M☉ black hole), high-spin
  (black hole J/M2 = 0.9) system with the K0 = 220 MeV Lattimer-Swesty
  EOS. We find that about 0.08 M☉ of nuclear matter is ejected from
  the system, while another 0.3 M☉ forms a hot, compact accretion
  disk. The primary effects of the escaping neutrinos are (1) to make
  the disk much denser and more compact, (2) to cause the average
  electron fraction Yeof the disk to rise to about 0.2 and then
  gradually decrease again, and (3) to gradually cool the disk. The
  disk is initially hot (T ~ 6 MeV) and luminous in neutrinos (Lν ~
  1054 erg s–1), but the neutrino luminosity decreases by an order of
  magnitude over 50 ms of post-merger evolution.
