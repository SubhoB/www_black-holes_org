  The numerical injection analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative
  effort between members of the numerical-relativity and gravitational
  wave data-analysis communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the
  sensitivity of existing gravitational-wave search and parameter-
  estimation algorithms using numerically generated waveforms and to
  foster closer collaboration between the numerical-relativity and
  data-analysis communities. The first NINJA project used only a small
  number of injections of short numerical-relativity waveforms, which
  limited its ability to draw quantitative conclusions. The goal of
  the NINJA-2 project is to overcome these limitations with long post-
  Newtonian—numerical-relativity hybrid waveforms, large numbers of
  injections and the use of real detector data. We report on the
  submission requirements for the NINJA-2 project and the construction
  of the waveform catalog. Eight numerical-relativity groups have
  contributed 56 hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion
  modeling the late inspiral, merger and ringdown stitched to a post-
  Newtonian portion modeling the early inspiral. We summarize the
  techniques used by each group in constructing their submissions. We
  also report on the procedures used to validate these submissions,
  including examination in the time and frequency domains and
  comparisons of waveforms from different groups against each other.
  These procedures have so far considered only the (ℓ, m) = (2, 2)
  mode. Based on these studies, we judge that the hybrid waveforms are
  suitable for NINJA-2 studies. We note some of the plans for these
  investigations.
