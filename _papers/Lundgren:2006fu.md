  Pointlike objects cause many of the divergences that afflict
  physical theories. For instance, the gravitational binding energy of
  a point particle in Newtonian mechanics is infinite. In general
  relativity, the analog of a point particle is a black hole and the
  notion of binding energy must be replaced by quasilocal energy. The
  quasilocal energy (QLE) derived by York, and elaborated by Brown and
  York, is finite outside the horizon but it was not considered how to
  evaluate it inside the horizon. We present a prescription for
  finding the QLE inside a horizon, and show that it is finite at the
  singularity for a variety of types of black hole. The energy is
  typically concentrated just inside the horizon, not at the central
  singularity.
