  This article studies sufficient accuracy criteria of hybrid post-
  Newtonian (PN) and numerical relativity (NR) waveforms for parameter
  estimation of strong binary black-hole sources in second-generation
  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We investigate equal-mass
  nonspinning binaries with a new 33-orbit NR waveform, as well as
  unequal-mass binaries with mass ratios 2, 3, 4 and 6. For equal
  masses, the 33-orbit NR waveform allows us to recover previous
  results and to extend the analysis toward matching at lower
  frequencies. For unequal masses, the errors between different PN
  approximants increase with mass ratio. Thus, at 3.5 PN, hybrids for
  higher-mass-ratio systems would require NR waveforms with many more
  gravitational-wave cycles to guarantee no adverse impact on
  parameter estimation. Furthermore, we investigate the potential
  improvement in hybrid waveforms that can be expected from fourth-
  order post-Newtonian waveforms and find that knowledge of this
  fourth post-Newtonian order would significantly improve the accuracy
  of hybrid waveforms.
