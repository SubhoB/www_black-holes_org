  We have modelled the nonlinear development of the secular bar-mode
  instability that is driven by gravitational radiation-reaction (GRR)
  forces in rotating neutron stars. In the absence of any competing
  viscous effects, an initially uniformly rotating, axisymmetric n=1/2
  polytropic star with a ratio of rotational to gravitational
  potential energy T/|W| = 0.181 is driven by GRR forces to a bar-like
  structure, as predicted by linear theory. The pattern frequency of
  the bar slows to nearly zero, that is, the bar becomes almost
  stationary as viewed from an inertial frame of reference as GRR
  removes energy and angular momentum from the star. In this
  "Dedekind-like" state, rotational energy is stored as motion of the
  fluid in highly noncircular orbits inside the bar. However, in less
  than 10 dynamical times after its formation, the bar loses its
  initially coherent structure as the ordered flow inside the bar is
  disrupted by what appears to be a purely hydrodynamical,
  short-wavelength, "shearing" type instability. The gravitational
  waveforms generated by such an event are determined, and an estimate
  of the detectability of these waves is presented.
