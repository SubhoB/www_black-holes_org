  We present the first surrogate model for gravitational waveforms
  from the coalescence of precessing binary black holes. We call this
  surrogate model NRSur4d2s. Our methodology significantly extends
  recently introduced reduced-order and surrogate modeling techniques,
  and is capable of directly modeling numerical relativity waveforms
  without introducing phenomenological assumptions or approximations
  to general relativity. Motivated by GW150914, LIGO’s first detection
  of gravitational waves from merging black holes, the model is built
  from a set of 276 numerical relativity (NR) simulations with mass
  ratios q≤2, dimensionless spin magnitudes up to 0.8, and the
  restriction that the initial spin of the smaller black hole lies
  along the axis of orbital angular momentum. It produces waveforms
  which begin ∼30 gravitational wave cycles before merger and continue
  through ringdown, and which contain the effects of precession as
  well as all ℓ∈{2,3} spin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes. We
  perform cross-validation studies to compare the model to NR
  waveforms not used to build the model and find a better agreement
  within the parameter range of the model than other, state-of-the-art
  precessing waveform models, with typical mismatches of 10-3. We also
  construct a frequency domain surrogate model (called
  NRSur4d2s_FDROM) which can be evaluated in 50 ms and is suitable for
  performing parameter estimation studies on gravitational wave
  detections similar to GW150914.
