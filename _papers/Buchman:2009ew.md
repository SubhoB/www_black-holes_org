  We generalize Bowen-York black hole initial data to hyperboloidal
  constant mean curvature slices which extend to future null
  infinity. We solve this initial value problem numerically for
  several cases, including unequal mass binary black holes with spins
  and boosts. The singularity at null infinity in the Hamiltonian
  constraint associated with a constant mean curvature hypersurface
  does not pose any particular difficulties. The inner boundaries of
  our slices are minimal surfaces. Trumpet configurations are explored
  both analytically and numerically.
