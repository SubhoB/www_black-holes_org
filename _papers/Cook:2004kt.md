  We define and extensively test a set of boundary conditions that can
  be applied at black hole excision surfaces when the Hamiltonian and
  momentum constraints of general relativity are solved within the
  conformal thin-sandwich formalism. These boundary conditions have
  been designed to result in black holes that are in quasiequilibrium
  and are completely general in the sense that they can be applied
  with any conformal three-geometry and slicing
  condition. Furthermore, we show that they retain precisely the
  freedom to specify an arbitrary spin on each black
  hole. Interestingly, we have been unable to find a boundary
  condition on the lapse that can be derived from a quasiequilibrium
  condition. Rather, we find evidence that the lapse boundary
  condition is part of the initial temporal gauge choice. To test
  these boundary conditions, we have extensively explored the case of
  a single black hole and the case of a binary system of equal-mass
  black holes, including the computation of quasi-circular orbits and
  the determination of the inner-most stable circular orbit. Our tests
  show that the boundary conditions work well.
