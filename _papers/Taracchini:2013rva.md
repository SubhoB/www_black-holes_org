  Gravitational waves emitted by black-hole binary systems have the
  highest signal-to-noise ratio in LIGO and Virgo detectors when
  black-hole spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum and
  extremal. For such systems, we extend the effective-one-body
  inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms to generic mass ratios and spins
  calibrating them to 38 numerical-relativity nonprecessing waveforms
  produced by the SXS Collaboration. The numerical-relativity
  simulations span mass ratios from 1 to 8, spin magnitudes up to 98%
  of extremality, and last for 40 to 60 gravitational-wave
  cycles. When the total mass of the binary is between 20Msun and
  200Msun, the effective-one-body nonprecessing (dominant mode)
  waveforms have overlaps above 99% (using the advanced-LIGO design
  noise spectral density) with all of the 38 nonprecessing numerical
  waveforms, when maximizing only on initial phase and time. This
  implies a negligible loss in event rate due to modeling. Moreover,
  without further calibration, we show that the precessing
  effective-one-body (dominant mode) waveforms have overlaps above 97%
  with two very long, strongly precessing numerical-relativity
  waveforms, when maximizing only on the initial phase and time.
