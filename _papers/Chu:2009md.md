  High-accuracy binary black hole simulations are presented for black
  holes with spins anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum. The
  particular case studied represents an equal-mass binary with spins
  of equal magnitude S/m2=0.437 57±0.000 01. The system has initial
  orbital eccentricity ∼4×10-5, and is evolved through 10.6 orbits
  plus merger and ringdown. The remnant mass and spin are
  Mf=(0.961 109±0.000 003)M and Sf/Mf2=0.547 81±0.000 01,
  respectively, where M is the mass during early inspiral. The
  gravitational waveforms have accumulated numerical phase errors of
  ≲0.1 radians without any time or phase shifts, and ≲0.01 radians
  when the waveforms are aligned with suitable time and phase
  shifts. The waveform is extrapolated to infinity using a procedure
  accurate to ≲0.01 radians in phase, and the extrapolated waveform
  differs by up to 0.13 radians in phase and about 1% in amplitude
  from the waveform extracted at finite radius r=350M. The simulations
  employ different choices for the constraint damping parameters in
  the wave zone; this greatly reduces the effects of junk radiation,
  allowing the extraction of a clean gravitational wave signal even
  very early in the simulation.
