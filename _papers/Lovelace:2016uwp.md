  In fall of 2015, the two LIGO detectors measured the gravitational
  wave signal GW150914, which originated from a pair of merging black
  holes (Abbott et al Virgo, LIGO Scientific 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116
  061102). In the final 0.2 s (about 8 gravitational-wave cycles)
  before the amplitude reached its maximum, the observed signal swept
  up in amplitude and frequency, from 35 Hz to 150 Hz. The theoretical
  gravitational-wave signal for merging black holes, as predicted by
  general relativity, can be computed only by full numerical
  relativity, because analytic approximations fail near the time of
  merger. Moreover, the nearly-equal masses, moderate spins, and small
  number of orbits of GW150914 are especially straightforward and
  efficient to simulate with modern numerical-relativity codes. In
  this paper, we report the modeling of GW150914 with numerical-
  relativity simulations, using black-hole masses and spins consistent
  with those inferred from LIGO’s measurement (Abbott et al LIGO
  Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett.
  116 241102). In particular, we employ two independent numerical-
  relativity codes that use completely different analytical and
  numerical methods to model the same merging black holes and to
  compute the emitted gravitational waveform, we find excellent
  agreement between the waveforms produced by the two independent
  codes. These results demonstrate the validity, impact, and potential
  of current and future studies using rapid-response, targeted
  numerical-relativity simulations for better understanding
  gravitational-wave observations.
