  First-order hyperbolic systems are promising as a basis for
  numerical integration of Einstein's equations. In previous work, the
  lapse and shift have typically not been considered part of the
  hyperbolic system and have been prescribed independently. This can
  be expensive computationally, especially if the prescription
  involves solving elliptic equations. Therefore, including the lapse
  and shift in the hyperbolic system could be advantageous for
  numerical work. In this paper, two first-order symmetrizable
  hyperbolic systems are presented that include the lapse and shift as
  dynamical fields and have only physical characteristic speeds.
