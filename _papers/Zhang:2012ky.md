  We investigate the suitability and properties of a quasi-Kinnersley
  tetrad and a geometrically motivated coordinate system as tools for
  quantifying both strong-field and wave-zone effects in numerical
  relativity (NR) simulations. We fix the radial and latitudinal
  coordinate degrees of freedom of the metric, using the Coulomb
  potential associated with the quasi-Kinnersley transverse frame.
  These coordinates are invariants of the spacetime and can be used to
  unambiguously fix the outstanding spin-boost freedom associated with
  the quasi-Kinnersley frame (resulting in a preferred quasi-
  Kinnersley tetrad (QKT)). In the limit of small perturbations about
  a Kerr spacetime, these coordinates and QKT reduce to Boyer-
  Lindquist coordinates and the Kinnersley tetrad, irrespective of the
  simulation gauge choice. We explore the properties of this
  construction both analytically and numerically, and we gain insights
  regarding the propagation of radiation described by a super-Poynting
  vector. We also quantify in detail the peeling properties of the
  chosen tetrad and gauge. We argue that these choices are
  particularly well suited for a rapidly converging wave-extraction
  algorithm as the extraction location approaches infinity, and we
  explore numerically the extent to which this property remains
  applicable on the interior of a computational domain. Using a number
  of additional tests, we verify that the prescription behaves as
  required in the appropriate limits regardless of simulation gauge.
  We explore the behavior of the geometrically motivated coordinate
  system in dynamical binary-black-hole NR mergers, and find them
  useful for visualizing features in NR simulations such as the
  spurious 'junk' radiation. Finally, we carefully scrutinize the
  head-on collision of two black holes and, for example, the way in
  which the extracted waveform changes as it moves through the
  computational domain.
