  Utilizing the tools of tendex and vortex, we study the highly
  dynamic plunge and merger phases of several &pi; -symmetric binary
  black hole coalescences. In particular, we observe a decline of the
  strength of the current quadrupole moment compared to that of the
  mass quadrupole moment during the merger phase, contrary to a naive
  estimate according to the dependence of these moments on the
  separation between the black holes. We further show that this
  decline of the current quadrupole moment is achieved through the
  remnants of the two individual spins becoming nearly aligned or
  anti-aligned with the total angular momentum. We also speculate on
  the ability to achieve a consistency between the electric and
  magnetic parity quasinormal modes.
