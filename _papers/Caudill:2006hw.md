  The construction of initial data for black-hole binaries usually
  involves the choice of free parameters that define the spins of the
  black holes and essentially the eccentricity of the orbit. Such
  parameters must be chosen carefully to yield initial data with the
  desired physical properties. In this paper, we examine these choices
  in detail for the quasiequilibrium method coupled to
  apparent-horizon/quasiequilibrium boundary conditions. First, we
  compare two independent criteria for choosing the orbital frequency,
  the "Komar-mass condition" and the "effective-potential method," and
  find excellent agreement. Second, we implement quasi-local measures
  of the spin of the individual holes, calibrate these with corotating
  binaries, and revisit the construction of non-spinning black hole
  binaries. Higher-order effects, beyond those considered in earlier
  work, turn out to be important. Without those, supposedly
  non-spinning black holes have appreciable quasi-local spin;
  furthermore, the Komar-mass condition and effective potential method
  agree only when these higher-order effects are taken into
  account. We compute a new sequence of quasi-circular orbits for
  non-spinning black-hole binaries, and determine the innermost stable
  circular orbit of this sequence.
