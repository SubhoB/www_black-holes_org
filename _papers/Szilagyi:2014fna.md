  As a network of advanced-era gravitational wave detectors is nearing
  its design sensitivity, efficient and accurate waveform modeling
  becomes more and more relevant. Understanding of the nature of the
  signal being sought can have an order unity effect on the event
  rates seen in these instruments. The paper provides a description of
  key elements of the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), with details of
  our spectral adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithm that has been
  optimized for binary black hole (BBH) evolutions. We expect that the
  gravitational waveform catalog produced by our code will have a
  central importance in both the detection and parameter estimation of
  gravitational waves in these instruments.
