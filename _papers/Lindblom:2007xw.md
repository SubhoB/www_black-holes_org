  The generalized harmonic representation of Einstein's equation is
  manifestly hyperbolic for a large class of gauge
  conditions. Unfortunately most of the useful gauges developed over
  the past several decades by the numerical relativity community are
  incompatible with the hyperbolicity of the equations in this
  form. This paper presents a new method of imposing gauge conditions
  that preserves hyperbolicity for a much wider class of conditions,
  including as special cases many of the standard ones used in
  numerical relativity: e.g., K-freezing, Gamma-freezing, Bona-Masso
  slicing, conformal Gamma-drivers, etc. Analytical and numerical
  results are presented which test the stability and the effectiveness
  of this new gauge driver evolution system.
