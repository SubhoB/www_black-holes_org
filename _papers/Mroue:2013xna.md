  This Letter presents a publicly available catalog of 174 numerical
  binary black hole simulations following up to 35 orbits. The catalog
  includes 91 precessing binaries, mass ratios up to 8∶1, orbital
  eccentricities from a few percent to 10-5, black hole spins up to
  98% of the theoretical maximum, and radiated energies up to 11.1% of
  the initial mass. We establish remarkably good agreement with post-
  Newtonian precession of orbital and spin directions for two new
  precessing simulations, and we discuss other applications of this
  catalog. Formidable challenges remain: e.g., precession complicates
  the connection of numerical and approximate analytical waveforms,
  and vast regions of the parameter space remain unexplored.
