  We calibrate an effective-one-body (EOB) model to numerical-
  relativity simulations of mass ratios 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, by
  maximizing phase and amplitude agreement of the leading (2,2) mode
  and of the subleading modes (2,1), (3,3), (4,4) and (5,5). Aligning
  the calibrated EOB waveforms and the numerical waveforms at low
  frequency, the phase difference of the (2,2) mode between model and
  numerical simulation remains below 0.1 rad throughout the evolution
  for all mass ratios considered. The fractional amplitude difference
  at peak amplitude of the (2,2) mode is 2% and grows to 12% during
  the ringdown. Using the Advanced LIGO noise curve we study the
  effectualness and measurement accuracy of the EOB model, and stress
  the relevance of modeling the higher-order modes for parameter
  estimation. We find that the effectualness, measured by the
  mismatch, between the EOB and numerical-relativity polarizations
  which include only the (2,2) mode is smaller than 0.2% for binaries
  with total mass 20-200 Msun and mass ratios 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. When
  numerical-relativity polarizations contain the strongest seven
  modes, and stellar-mass black holes with masses less than 50Msun are
  considered, the mismatch for mass ratio 6 (1) can be as high as 5%
  (0.2%) when only the EOB (2,2) mode is included, and an upper bound
  of the mismatch is 0.5% (0.07%) when all the four subleading EOB
  modes calibrated in this paper are taken into account. For binaries
  with intermediate-mass black holes with masses greater than 50Msun
  the mismatches are larger. We also determine for which signal-to-
  noise ratios the EOB model developed here can be used to measure
  binary parameters with systematic biases smaller than statistical
  errors due to detector noise.
