  New boundary conditions are constructed and tested numerically for a
  general first-order form of the Einstein evolution system. These
  conditions prevent constraint violations from entering the
  computational domain through timelike boundaries, allow the
  simulation of isolated systems by preventing physical gravitational
  waves from entering the computational domain, and are designed to be
  compatible with the fixed-gauge evolutions used here. These new
  boundary conditions are shown to be effective in limiting the growth
  of constraints in 3D nonlinear numerical evolutions of dynamical
  black-hole spacetimes.
