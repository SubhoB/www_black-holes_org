  Gravitational waves from coalescing stellar-mass black hole binaries
  (BBHs) are expected to be detected by the Advanced Laser
  Interferometer gravitational-wave observatory and Advanced Virgo.
  Detection searches operate by matched filtering the detector data
  using a bank of waveform templates. Traditionally, template banks
  for BBHs are constructed from intermediary analytical waveform
  models which are calibrated against numerical relativity simulations
  and which can be evaluated for any choice of BBH parameters. This
  paper explores an alternative to the traditional approach, namely,
  the construction of template banks directly from numerical BBH
  simulations. Using nonspinning BBH systems as an example, we
  demonstrate which regions of the mass-parameter plane can be covered
  with existing numerical BBH waveforms. We estimate the required
  number and required length of BBH simulations to cover the entire
  nonspinning BBH parameter plane up to mass ratio 10, thus
  illustrating that our approach can be used to guide parameter
  placement of future numerical simulations. We derive error bounds
  which are independent of analytical waveform models; therefore, our
  formalism can be used to independently test the accuracy of such
  waveform models. The resulting template banks are suitable for
  advanced LIGO searches.
