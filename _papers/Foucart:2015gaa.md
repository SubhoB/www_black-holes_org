  Neutron star mergers are among the most promising sources of
  gravitational waves for advanced ground-based detectors. These
  mergers are also expected to power bright electromagnetic signals,
  in the form of short gamma-ray bursts, infrared/optical transients
  powered by r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron-rich material
  ejected by the merger, and radio emission from the interaction of
  that ejecta with the interstellar medium. Simulations of these
  mergers with fully general relativistic codes are critical to
  understand the merger and postmerger gravitational wave signals and
  their neutrinos and electromagnetic counterparts. In this paper, we
  employ the Spectral Einstein Code to simulate the merger of low mass
  neutron star binaries (two 1.2MâŠ™ neutron stars) for a set of three
  nuclear-theory-based, finite temperature equations of state. We show
  that the frequency peaks of the postmerger gravitational wave signal
  are in good agreement with predictions obtained from recent
  simulations using a simpler treatment of gravity. We find, however,
  that only the fundamental mode of the remnant is excited for long
  periods of time: emission at the secondary peaks is damped on a
  millisecond time scale in the simulated binaries. For such low mass
  systems, the remnant is a massive neutron star which, depending on
  the equation of state, is either permanently stable or long lived
  (i.e. rapid uniform rotation is sufficient to prevent its collapse).
  We observe strong excitations of l=2, m=2 modes, both in the massive
  neutron star and in the form of hot, shocked tidal arms in the
  surrounding accretion torus. We estimate the neutrino emission of
  the remnant using a neutrino leakage scheme and, in one case,
  compare these results with a gray two-moment neutrino transport
  scheme. We confirm the complex geometry of the neutrino emission,
  also observed in previous simulations with neutrino leakage, and
  show explicitly the presence of important differences in the
  neutrino luminosity, disk composition, and outflow properties
  between the neutrino leakage and transport schemes.
