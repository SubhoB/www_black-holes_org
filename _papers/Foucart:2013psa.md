  We present the first direct comparison of numerical simulations of
  neutron star-black hole and black hole-black hole mergers in full
  general relativity. We focus on a configuration with nonspinning
  objects and within the most likely range of mass ratio for neutron
  star-black hole systems (q=6). In this region of the parameter
  space, the neutron star is not tidally disrupted prior to merger,
  and we show that the two types of mergers appear remarkably similar.
  The effect of the presence of a neutron star on the gravitational
  wave signal is not only undetectable by the next generation of
  gravitational wave detectors, but also too small to be measured in
  the numerical simulations: even the plunge, merger and ringdown
  signals appear in perfect agreement for both types of binaries. The
  characteristics of the post-merger remnants are equally similar,
  with the masses of the final black holes agreeing within
  δMBH<5×10-4MBH and their dimensionless spins within δχBH<10-3. The
  rate of periastron advance in the mixed binary agrees with
  previously published binary black hole results, and we use the
  inspiral waveforms to place constraints on the accuracy of our
  numerical simulations independent of algorithmic choices made for
  each type of binary. Overall, our results indicate that
  nondisrupting neutron star-black hole mergers are exceptionally well
  modeled by black hole-black hole mergers, and that given the absence
  of mass ejection, accretion disk formation, or differences in the
  gravitational wave signals, only electromagnetic precursors could
  prove the presence of a neutron star in low-spin systems of total
  mass ∼10M⊙, at least until the advent of gravitational wave
  detectors with a sensitivity comparable to that of the proposed
  Einstein Telescope.
