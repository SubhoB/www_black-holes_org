  Coalescing binary black holes are among the primary science targets
  for second generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors.
  Reliable gravitational waveform models are central to detection of
  such systems and subsequent parameter estimation. This paper
  performs a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of recent waveform
  models for binary black holes with aligned spins, utilizing a new
  set of 84 high-accuracy numerical relativity simulations. Our
  analysis covers comparable mass binaries (mass-ratio 1≤q≤3), and
  samples independently both black hole spins up to a dimensionless
  spin magnitude of 0.9 for equal-mass binaries and 0.85 for unequal
  mass binaries. Furthermore, we focus on the high-mass regime (total
  mass ≳50M⊙). The two most recent waveform models considered (PhenomD
  and SEOBNRv2) both perform very well for signal detection, losing
  less than 0.5% of the recoverable signal-to-noise ratio ρ, except
  that SEOBNRv2’s efficiency drops slightly for both black hole spins
  aligned at large magnitude. For parameter estimation, modeling
  inaccuracies of the SEOBNRv2 model are found to be smaller than
  systematic uncertainties for moderately strong GW events up to
  roughly ρ≲15. PhenomD’s modeling errors are found to be smaller than
  SEOBNRv2’s, and are generally irrelevant for ρ≲20. Both models’
  accuracy deteriorates with increased mass ratio, and when at least
  one black hole spin is large and aligned. The SEOBNRv2 model shows a
  pronounced disagreement with the numerical relativity simulation in
  the merger phase, for unequal masses and simultaneously both black
  hole spins very large and aligned. Two older waveform models
  (PhenomC and SEOBNRv1) are found to be distinctly less accurate than
  the more recent PhenomD and SEOBNRv2 models. Finally, we quantify
  the bias expected from all four waveform models during parameter
  estimation for several recovered binary parameters: chirp mass, mass
  ratio, and effective spin.
