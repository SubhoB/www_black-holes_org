  We study the issue of algebraic classification of the Weyl curvature
  tensor, with a particular focus on numerical relativity
  simulations. The spacetimes of interest in this context, binary
  black hole mergers, and the ringdowns that follow them, present
  subtleties in that they are generically, strictly speaking, type I,
  but in many regions approximately, in some sense, type D. To provide
  meaning to any claims of “approximate” Petrov class, one must define
  a measure of degeneracy on the space of null rays at a point. We
  will investigate such a measure, used recently to argue that certain
  binary black hole merger simulations ring down to the Kerr geometry,
  after hanging up for some time in Petrov type II. In particular, we
  argue that this hangup in Petrov type II is an artefact of the
  particular measure being used, and that a geometrically
  better-motivated measure shows a black hole merger produced by our
  group settling directly to Petrov type D.
