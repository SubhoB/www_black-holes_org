  The LIGO detection of GW150914 provides an unprecedented opportunity
  to study the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the
  large-velocity, highly nonlinear regime, and to witness the final
  merger of the binary and the excitation of uniquely relativistic
  modes of the gravitational field. We carry out several
  investigations to determine whether GW150914 is consistent with a
  binary black-hole merger in general relativity. We find that the
  final remnant’s mass and spin, as determined from the low-frequency
  (inspiral) and high-frequency (postinspiral) phases of the signal,
  are mutually consistent with the binary black-hole solution in
  general relativity. Furthermore, the data following the peak of
  GW150914 are consistent with the least-damped quasinormal mode
  inferred from the mass and spin of the remnant black hole. By using
  waveform models that allow for parametrized general-relativity
  violations during the inspiral and merger phases, we perform
  quantitative tests on the gravitational-wave phase in the dynamical
  regime and we determine the first empirical bounds on several high-
  order post-Newtonian coefficients. We constrain the graviton Compton
  wavelength, assuming that gravitons are dispersed in vacuum in the
  same way as particles with mass, obtaining a 90%-confidence lower
  bound of 1013  km. In conclusion, within our statistical
  uncertainties, we find no evidence for violations of general
  relativity in the genuinely strong-field regime of gravity.
