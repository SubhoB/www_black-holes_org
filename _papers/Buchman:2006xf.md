  We construct exact solutions to the Bianchi equations on a flat
  spacetime background. When the constraints are satisfied, these
  solutions represent in- and outgoing linearized gravitational
  radiation. We then consider the Bianchi equations on a subset of
  flat spacetime of the form \([0,T] \times B_R\), where \(B_R\) is a
  ball of radius \(R\), and analyze different kinds of boundary
  conditions on \(\partial B_R\). Our main results are: i) We give an
  explicit analytic example showing that boundary conditions obtained
  from freezing the incoming characteristic fields to their initial
  values are not compatible with the constraints. ii) With the help of
  the exact solutions constructed, we determine the amount of
  artificial reflection of gravitational radiation from
  constraint-preserving boundary conditions which freeze the Weyl
  scalar \(\Psi_0\) to its initial value. For monochromatic radiation
  with wave number k and arbitrary angular momentum number \(\ell \geq
  2\), the amount of reflection decays as \(1/(kR)^4\) for large
  \(kR\). iii) For each \(L \geq 2\), we construct new local
  constraint-preserving boundary conditions which perfectly absorb
  linearized radiation with \(\ell \leq L\). (iv) We generalize our
  analysis to a weakly curved background of mass \(M\), and compute
  first order corrections in M/R to the reflection coefficients for
  quadrupolar odd-parity radiation. For our new boundary condition
  with \(L=2\), the reflection coefficient is smaller than the one for
  the freezing \(\Psi_0\) boundary condition by a factor of \(M/R\)
  for \(kR &gt; 1.04\). Implications of these results for numerical
  simulations of binary black holes on finite domains are discussed.
