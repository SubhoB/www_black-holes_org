  The increasing sophistication and accuracy of numerical simulations
  of compact binaries (especially binary black holes) presents the
  opportunity to test the regime in which post-Newtonian (PN)
  predictions for the emitted gravitational waves are accurate. In
  order to confront numerical results with those of post-Newtonian
  theory, it is convenient to compare multipolar decompositions of the
  two waveforms. It is pointed out here that the individual modes can
  be computed to higher post-Newtonian order by examining the
  radiative multipole moments of the system, rather than by
  decomposing the 2.5PN polarization waveforms. In particular, the
  dominant (l = 2, m = 2) mode can be computed to 3PN
  order. Individual modes are computed to as high a post-Newtonian
  order as possible given previous post-Newtonian results.
