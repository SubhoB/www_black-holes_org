  We extract gravitational waveforms from numerical simulations of
  black hole binaries computed using the Spectral Einstein Code. We
  compare two extraction methods: direct construction of the
  Newman-Penrose (NP) scalar \(\Psi_4\) at a finite distance from the
  source and Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE). The direct NP
  approach is simpler than CCE, but NP waveforms can be contaminated
  by near-zone effects---unless the waves are extracted at several
  distances from the source and extrapolated to infinity. Even then,
  the resulting waveforms can in principle be contaminated by gauge
  effects. In contrast, CCE directly provides, by construction,
  gauge-invariant waveforms at future null infinity. We verify the
  gauge invariance of CCE by running the same physical simulation
  using two different gauge conditions. We find that these two gauge
  conditions produce the same CCE waveforms but show differences in
  extrapolated-\(\Psi_4\) waveforms. We examine data from several
  different binary configurations and measure the dominant sources of
  error in the extrapolated-\(\Psi_4\) and CCE waveforms. In some
  cases, we find that NP waveforms extrapolated to infinity agree with
  the corresponding CCE waveforms to within the estimated error
  bars. However, we find that in other cases extrapolated and CCE
  waveforms disagree, most notably for \(m=0\) "memory" modes.
