  Numerical simulations of 15 orbits of an equal-mass binary
  black-hole system are presented. Gravitational waveforms from these
  simulations, covering more than 30 cycles and ending about 1.5
  cycles before merger, are compared with those from quasicircular
  zero-spin post-Newtonian (PN) formulae. The cumulative phase
  uncertainty of these comparisons is about 0.05 radians, dominated by
  effects arising from the small residual spins of the black holes and
  the small residual orbital eccentricity in the simulations. Matching
  numerical results to PN waveforms early in the run yields excellent
  agreement (within 0.05 radians) over the first ~15 cycles, thus
  validating the numerical simulation and establishing a regime where
  PN theory is accurate. In the last 15 cycles to merger, however,
  generic time-domain Taylor approximants build up phase differences
  of several radians. But, apparently by coincidence, one specific
  post-Newtonian approximant, TaylorT4 at 3.5PN order, agrees much
  better with the numerical simulations, with accumulated phase
  differences of less than 0.05 radians over the 30-cycle
  waveform. Gravitational-wave amplitude comparisons are also done
  between numerical simulations and post-Newtonian, and the agreement
  depends on the post-Newtonian order of the amplitude expansion: the
  amplitude difference is about 6%–7% for zeroth order and becomes
  smaller for increasing order. A newly derived 3.0PN amplitude
  correction improves agreement significantly (&lt;1% amplitude
  difference throughout most of the run, increasing to 4% near merger)
  over the previously known 2.5PN amplitude terms.
