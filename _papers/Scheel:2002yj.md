  Three dimensional (3D) numerical evolutions of static black holes
  with excision are presented. These evolutions extend to about 8000M,
  where M is the mass of the black hole. This degree of stability is
  achieved by using growth-rate estimates to guide the fine tuning of
  the parameters in a multiparameter family of symmetric hyperbolic
  representations of the Einstein evolution equations. These
  evolutions were performed using a fixed gauge in order to separate
  the intrinsic stability of the evolution equations from the effects
  of stability-enhancing gauge choices.
