  We present a scheme for generating first-order metric perturbation
  initial data for an arbitrary background and source. We then apply
  this scheme to derive metric perturbations in order-reduced
  dynamical Chern–Simons gravity (dCS). In particular, we solve for
  metric perturbations on a black hole background that are sourced by
  a first-order dCS scalar field. This gives us the leading-order
  metric perturbation to the spacetime in dCS gravity. We then use
  these solutions to compute black hole shadows in the linearly
  perturbed spacetime by evolving null geodesics. We present a novel
  scheme to decompose the shape of the shadow into multipoles
  parametrized by the spin of the background black hole and the
  perturbation parameter . We find that we can differentiate the
  presence of a pure Kerr spacetime from a spacetime with a dCS
  perturbation using the shadow, allowing in part for a null-
  hypothesis test of general relativity. We then consider these
  results in the context of the event horizon telescope.
