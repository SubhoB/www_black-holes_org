  Current spectral simulations of Einstein's equations require writing
  the equations in first-order form, potentially introducing
  instabilities and inefficiencies. We present a new penalty method
  for pseudo-spectral evolutions of second order in space wave
  equations. The penalties are constructed as functions of Legendre
  polynomials and are added to the equations of motion everywhere, not
  only on the boundaries. Using energy methods, we prove semi-discrete
  stability of the new method for the scalar wave equation in flat
  space and show how it can be applied to the scalar wave on a curved
  background. Numerical results demonstrating stability and
  convergence for multi-domain second-order scalar wave evolutions are
  also presented. This work provides a foundation for treating
  Einstein's equations directly in second-order form by spectral
  methods.
