  Research on extracting science from binary-black-hole (BBH)
  simulations has often adopted a "scattering matrix" perspective:
  given the binary's initial parameters, what are the final hole's
  parameters and the emitted gravitational waveform? In contrast, we
  are using BBH simulations to explore the nonlinear dynamics of
  curved spacetime. Focusing on the head-on plunge, merger, and
  ringdown of a BBH with transverse, antiparallel spins, we explore
  numerically the momentum flow between the holes and the surrounding
  spacetime. We use the Landau-Lifshitz field-theory-in-flat-spacetime
  formulation of general relativity to define and compute the density
  of field energy and field momentum outside horizons and the energy
  and momentum contained within horizons, and we define the effective
  velocity of each apparent and event horizon as the ratio of its
  enclosed momentum to its enclosed mass-energy. We find surprisingly
  good agreement between the horizons' effective and coordinate
  velocities. To investigate the gauge dependence of our results, we
  compare pseudospectral and moving-puncture evolutions of physically
  similar initial data; although spectral and puncture simulations use
  different gauge conditions, we find remarkably good agreement for
  our results in these two cases. We also compare our simulations with
  the post-Newtonian trajectories and near-field energy-
  momentum. [Abstract abbreviated; full abstract also mentions
  additional results.]
