  We show how to solve hyperbolic equations numerically on unbounded
  domains by compactification, thereby avoiding the introduction of an
  artificial outer boundary. The essential ingredient is a suitable
  transformation of the time coordinate in combination with spatial
  compactification. We construct a new layer method based on this
  idea, called the hyperboloidal layer. The method is demonstrated on
  numerical tests including the one dimensional Maxwell equations
  using finite differences and the three dimensional wave equation
  with and without nonlinear source terms using spectral techniques.
