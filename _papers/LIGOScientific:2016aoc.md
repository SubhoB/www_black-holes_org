  On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser
  Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously
  observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps
  upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-
  wave strain of 1.0×10−21. It matches the waveform predicted by
  general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black
  holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The
  signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of
  24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per
  203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1σ. The
  source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160−180  Mpc
  corresponding to a redshift z=0.09+0.03−0.04. In the source frame,
  the initial black hole masses are 36+5−4M⊙ and 29+4−4M⊙, and the
  final black hole mass is 62+4−4M⊙, with 3.0+0.5−0.5M⊙c2 radiated in
  gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible
  intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary
  stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection
  of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black
  hole merger.
