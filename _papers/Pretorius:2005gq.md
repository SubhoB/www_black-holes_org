  We describe early success in the evolution of binary black hole
  spacetimes with a numerical code based on a generalization of
  harmonic coordinates. Indications are that with sufficient
  resolution this scheme is capable of evolving binary systems for
  enough time to extract information about the orbit, merger and
  gravitational waves emitted during the event. As an example we show
  results from the evolution of a binary composed of two equal mass,
  non-spinning black holes, through a single plunge-orbit, merger and
  ring down. The resultant black hole is estimated to be a Kerr black
  hole with angular momentum parameter a~0.70. At present, lack of
  resolution far from the binary prevents an accurate estimate of the
  energy emitted, though a rough calculation suggests on the order of
  5% of the initial rest mass of the system is radiated as
  gravitational waves during the final orbit and ringdown.
