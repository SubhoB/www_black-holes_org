  We present gauge invariant spectral Cauchy characteristic
  extraction. We compare gravitational waveforms extracted from a
  head-on black hole merger simulated in two different gauges by two
  different codes. We show rapid convergence, demonstrating both gauge
  invariance of the extraction algorithm and consistency between the
  legacy Pitt null code and the much faster spectral Einstein code
  (SpEC).
