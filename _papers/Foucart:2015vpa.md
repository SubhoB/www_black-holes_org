  We present a first simulation of the post-merger evolution of a
  black hole-neutron star binary in full general relativity using an
  energy-integrated general-relativistic truncated moment formalism
  for neutrino transport. We describe our implementation of the moment
  formalism and important tests of our code, before studying the
  formation phase of an accretion disk after a black hole-neutron star
  merger. We use as initial data an existing general-relativistic
  simulation of the merger of a neutron star of mass 1.4M⊙ with a
  black hole of mass 7M⊙ and dimensionless spin χBH=0.8. Comparing
  with a simpler leakage scheme for the treatment of the neutrinos, we
  find noticeable differences in the neutron-to-proton ratio in and
  around the disk, and in the neutrino luminosity. We find that the
  electron neutrino luminosity is much lower in the transport
  simulations, and that both the disk and the disk outflows are less
  neutron rich. The spatial distribution of the neutrinos is
  significantly affected by relativistic effects, due to large
  velocities and curvature in the regions of strongest emission. Over
  the short time scale evolved, we do not observe purely neutrino-
  driven outflows. However, a small amount of material (3×10-4M⊙) is
  ejected in the polar region during the circularization of the disk.
  Most of that material is ejected early in the formation of the disk,
  and is fairly neutron rich (electron fraction Ye∼0.15–0.25). Through
  r-process nucleosynthesis, that material should produce high-opacity
  lanthanides in the polar region, and could thus affect the light
  curve of radioactively powered electromagnetic transients. We also
  show that by the end of the simulation, while the bulk of the disk
  remains neutron rich (Ye∼0.15–0.2 and decreasing), its outer layers
  have a higher electron fraction: 10% of the remaining mass has
  Ye>0.3. As that material would be the first to be unbound by disk
  outflows on longer time scales, and as composition evolution is
  slower at later times, the changes in Ye experienced during the
  formation phase of the disk could have an impact on nucleosynthesis
  outputs from neutrino-driven and viscously driven outflows. Finally,
  we find that the effective viscosity due to momentum transport by
  neutrinos is unlikely to have a strong effect on the growth of the
  magnetorotational instability in the post-merger accretion disk.
