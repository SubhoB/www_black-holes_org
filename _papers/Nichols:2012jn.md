  In recent papers, we and colleagues have introduced a way to
  visualize the full vacuum Riemann curvature tensor using frame-drag
  vortex lines and their vorticities, and tidal tendex lines and their
  tendicities. We have also introduced the concepts of horizon
  vortexes and tendexes and 3-D vortexes and tendexes (regions where
  vorticities or tendicities are large). Using these concepts, we
  discover a number of previously unknown features of quasinormal
  modes of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. These modes can be
  classified by mode indexes \((n,l,m)\), and parity, which can be
  electric \([(-1)^l]\) or magnetic \([(-1)^{l+1}]\). Among our
  discoveries are these: (i) There is a near duality between modes of
  the same \((n,l,m)\): a duality in which the tendex and vortex
  structures of electric-parity modes are interchanged with the vortex
  and tendex structures (respectively) of magnetic-parity modes. (ii)
  This near duality is perfect for the modes' complex eigenfrequencies
  (which are well known to be identical) and perfect on the horizon;
  it is slightly broken in the equatorial plane of a non-spinning
  hole, and the breaking becomes greater out of the equatorial plane,
  and greater as the hole is spun up; but even out of the plane for
  fast-spinning holes, the duality is surprisingly good. (iii)
  Electric-parity modes can be regarded as generated by 3-D tendexes
  that stick radially out of the horizon. As these "longitudinal,"
  near-zone tendexes rotate or oscillate, they generate
  longitudinal-transverse near-zone vortexes and tendexes, and
  outgoing and ingoing gravitational waves. The ingoing waves act back
  on the longitudinal tendexes, driving them to slide off the horizon,
  which results in decay of the mode's strength. (iv) By duality,
  magnetic-parity modes are driven in this same manner by
  longitudinal, near-zone vortexes that stick out of the
  horizon. [Abstract abridged.]
