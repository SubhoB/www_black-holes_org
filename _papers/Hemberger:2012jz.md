  Simulations of binary black hole systems using the Spectral Einstein
  Code (SpEC) are done on a computational domain that excises the
  regions inside the black holes. It is imperative that the excision
  boundaries are outflow boundaries with respect to the hyperbolic
  evolution equations used in the simulation. We employ a time-
  dependent mapping between the fixed computational frame and the
  inertial frame through which the black holes move. The time-
  dependent parameters of the mapping are adjusted throughout the
  simulation by a feedback control system in order to follow the
  motion of the black holes, to adjust the shape and size of the
  excision surfaces so that they remain outflow boundaries, and to
  prevent large distortions of the grid. We describe in detail the
  mappings and control systems that we use. We show how these
  techniques have been essential in the evolution of binary black hole
  systems with extreme configurations, such as large spin magnitudes
  and high mass ratios, especially during the merger, when apparent
  horizons are highly distorted and the computational domain becomes
  compressed. The techniques introduced here may be useful in other
  applications of partial differential equations that involve time-
  dependent mappings.
