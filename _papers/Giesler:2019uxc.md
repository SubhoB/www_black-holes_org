  It is possible to infer the mass and spin of the remnant black hole
  from binary black hole mergers by comparing the ringdown
  gravitational wave signal to results from studies of perturbed Kerr
  spacetimes. Typically, these studies are based on the fundamental
  quasinormal mode of the dominant ℓ=m=2 harmonic. By modeling the
  ringdown of accurate numerical relativity simulations, we find, in
  agreement with previous findings, that the fundamental mode alone is
  insufficient to recover the true underlying mass and spin, unless
  the analysis is started very late in the ringdown. Including higher
  overtones associated with this ℓ=m=2 harmonic resolves this issue
  and provides an unbiased estimate of the true remnant parameters.
  Further, including overtones allows for the modeling of the ringdown
  signal for all times beyond the peak strain amplitude, indicating
  that the linear quasinormal regime starts much sooner than
  previously expected. This result implies that the spacetime is well
  described as a linearly perturbed black hole with a fixed mass and
  spin as early as the peak. A model for the ringdown beginning at the
  peak strain amplitude can exploit the higher signal-to-noise ratio
  in detectors, reducing uncertainties in the extracted remnant
  quantities. These results should be taken into consideration when
  testing the no-hair theorem.
