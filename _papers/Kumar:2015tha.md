  Coalescing binaries of neutron stars and black holes are one of the
  most important sources of gravitational waves for the upcoming
  network of ground-based detectors. Detection and extraction of
  astrophysical information from gravitational-wave signals requires
  accurate waveform models. The effective-one-body and other
  phenomenological models interpolate between analytic results and
  numerical relativity simulations, that typically span O(10) orbits
  before coalescence. In this paper we study the faithfulness of these
  models for neutron star-black hole binaries. We investigate their
  accuracy using new numerical relativity (NR) simulations that span
  36–88 orbits, with mass ratios q and black hole spins χBH of
  (q,χBH)=(7,±0.4),(7,±0.6), and (5,-0.9). These simulations were
  performed treating the neutron star as a low-mass black hole,
  ignoring its matter effects. We find that (i) the recently published
  SEOBNRv1 and SEOBNRv2 models of the effective-one-body family
  disagree with each other (mismatches of a few percent) for black
  hole spins χBH≥0.5 or χBH≤-0.3, with waveform mismatch accumulating
  during early inspiral; (ii) comparison with numerical waveforms
  indicates that this disagreement is due to phasing errors of
  SEOBNRv1, with SEOBNRv2 in good agreement with all of our
  simulations; (iii) phenomenological waveforms agree with SEOBNRv2
  only for comparable-mass low-spin binaries, with overlaps below 0.7
  elsewhere in the neutron star-black hole binary parameter space;
  (iv) comparison with numerical waveforms shows that most of this
  model’s dephasing accumulates near the frequency interval where it
  switches to a phenomenological phasing prescription; and finally
  (v) both SEOBNR and post-Newtonian models are effectual for neutron
  star-black hole systems, but post-Newtonian waveforms will give a
  significant bias in parameter recovery. Our results suggest that
  future gravitational-wave detection searches and parameter
  estimation efforts would benefit from using SEOBNRv2 waveform
  templates when focused on neutron star-black hole systems with q≲7
  and χBH≈[-0.9,+0.6]. For larger black hole spins and/or binary mass
  ratios, we recommend the models be further investigated as NR
  simulations in that region of the parameter space become available.
