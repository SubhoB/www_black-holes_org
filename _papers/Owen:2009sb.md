  Methods are presented to define and compute source multipoles of
  dynamical horizons in numerical relativity codes, extending previous
  work in the isolated and dynamical horizon formalisms to allow for
  horizons that are not axisymmetric. These methods are then applied
  to a binary black hole merger simulation, providing evidence that
  the final remnant is a Kerr black hole, both through the (spatially)
  gauge-invariant recovery of the geometry of the apparent horizon,
  and through a detailed extraction of quasinormal ringing modes
  directly from the strong-field region.
