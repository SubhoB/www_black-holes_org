  The accuracy and stability of the Caltech-Cornell pseudospectral
  code is evaluated using the KST representation of the Einstein
  evolution equations. The basic "Mexico City Tests" widely adopted by
  the numerical relativity community are adapted here for codes based
  on spectral methods. Exponential convergence of the spectral code is
  established, apparently limited only by numerical roundoff error. A
  general expression for the growth of errors due to finite machine
  precision is derived, and it is shown that this limit is achieved
  here for the linear plane-wave test. All of these tests are found to
  be stable, except for simulations of high amplitude gauge waves with
  nontrivial shift.
