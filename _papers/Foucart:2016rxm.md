  Binary neutron star mergers are promising sources of gravitational
  waves for ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO. Neutron-rich
  material ejected by these mergers may also be the main source of
  r-process elements in the Universe, while radioactive decays in the
  ejecta can power bright electromagnetic postmerger signals.
  Neutrino-matter interactions play a critical role in the evolution
  of the composition of the ejected material, which significantly
  impacts the outcome of nucleosynthesis and the properties of the
  associated electromagnetic signal. In this work, we present a
  simulation of a binary neutron star merger using an improved method
  for estimating the average neutrino energies in our energy-
  integrated neutrino transport scheme. These energy estimates are
  obtained by evolving the neutrino number density in addition to the
  neutrino energy and flux densities. We show that significant changes
  are observed in the composition of the polar ejecta when comparing
  our new results with earlier simulations in which the neutrino
  spectrum was assumed to be the same everywhere in optically thin
  regions. In particular, we find that material ejected in the polar
  regions is less neutron rich than previously estimated. Our new
  estimates of the composition of the polar ejecta make it more likely
  that the color and time scale of the electromagnetic signal depend
  on the orientation of the binary with respect to an observerâ€™s line
  of sight. These results also indicate that important observable
  properties of neutron star mergers are sensitive to the neutrino
  energy spectrum, and may need to be studied through simulations
  including a more accurate, energy-dependent neutrino transport
  scheme.
