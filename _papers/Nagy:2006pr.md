  We discuss the initial-boundary value problem of General
  Relativity. Previous considerations for a toy model problem in
  electrodynamics motivate the introduction of a variational principle
  for the lapse with several attractive properties. In particular, it
  is argued that the resulting elliptic gauge condition for the lapse
  together with a suitable condition for the shift and
  constraint-preserving boundary conditions controlling the Weyl
  scalar \(\Psi_0\) are expected to yield a well posed
  initial-boundary value problem for metric formulations of Einstein's
  field equations which are commonly used in numerical relativity. To
  present a simple and explicit example we consider the 3+1
  decomposition introduced by York of the field equations on a cubic
  domain with two periodic directions and prove in the weak field
  limit that our gauge condition for the lapse and our boundary
  conditions lead to a well posed problem. The method discussed here
  is quite general and should also yield well posed problems for
  different ways of writing the evolution equations, including first
  order symmetric hyperbolic or mixed first-order second-order
  formulations. Well posed initial-boundary value formulations for the
  linearization about arbitrary stationary configurations will be
  presented elsewhere.
