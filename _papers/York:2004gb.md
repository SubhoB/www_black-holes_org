  The initial value problem is introduced after a thorough review of
  the essential geometry. The initial value equations are put into
  elliptic form using both conformal transformations and a treatment
  of the extrinsic curvature introduced recently. This use of the
  metric and the extrinsic curvature is manifestly equivalent to the
  author's conformal thin sandwich formulation. Therefore, the
  reformulation of the constraints as an elliptic system by use of
  conformal techniques is complete.
