  We present a time domain waveform model that describes the inspiral,
  merger and ringdown of compact binary systems whose components are
  nonspinning, and which evolve on orbits with low to moderate
  eccentricity. The inspiral evolution is described using third-order
  post-Newtonian equations both for the equations of motion of the
  binary, and its far-zone radiation field. This latter component also
  includes instantaneous, tails and tails-of-tails contributions, and
  a contribution due to nonlinear memory. This framework reduces to
  the post-Newtonian approximant TaylorT4 at third post-Newtonian
  order in the zero-eccentricity limit. To improve phase accuracy, we
  also incorporate higher-order post-Newtonian corrections for the
  energy flux of quasicircular binaries and gravitational self-force
  corrections to the binding energy of compact binaries. This enhanced
  prescription for the inspiral evolution is combined with a fully
  analytical prescription for the merger-ringdown evolution
  constructed using a catalog of numerical relativity simulations. We
  show that this inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model reproduces
  the effective-one-body model of Ref. [Y. Pan , Phys. Rev. D 89,
  061501 (2014).PRVDAQ1550-799810.1103/PhysRevD.89.061501] for
  quasicircular black hole binaries with mass ratios between 1 to 15
  in the zero-eccentricity limit over a wide range of the parameter
  space under consideration. Using a set of eccentric numerical
  relativity simulations, not used during calibration, we show that
  our new eccentric model reproduces the true features of eccentric
  compact binary coalescence throughout merger. We use this model to
  show that the gravitational-wave transients GW150914 and GW151226
  can be effectively recovered with template banks of quasicircular,
  spin-aligned waveforms if the eccentricity e0 of these systems when
  they enter the aLIGO band at a gravitational-wave frequency of 14 Hz
  satisfies e0GW150914≤0.15 and e0GW151226≤0.1. We also find that
  varying the spin combinations of the quasicircular, spin-aligned
  template waveforms does not improve the recovery of nonspinning,
  eccentric signals when e0≥0.1. This suggests that these two signal
  manifolds are predominantly orthogonal.
