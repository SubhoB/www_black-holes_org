  The Numerical–Relativity–Analytical–Relativity (NRAR) collaboration
  is a joint effort between members of the numerical relativity,
  analytical relativity and gravitational-wave data analysis
  communities. The goal of the NRAR collaboration is to produce
  numerical-relativity simulations of compact binaries and use them to
  develop accurate analytical templates for the LIGO/Virgo
  Collaboration to use in detecting gravitational-wave signals and
  extracting astrophysical information from them. We describe the
  results of the first stage of the NRAR project, which focused on
  producing an initial set of numerical waveforms from binary black
  holes with moderate mass ratios and spins, as well as one non-
  spinning binary configuration which has a mass ratio of 10. All of
  the numerical waveforms are analysed in a uniform and consistent
  manner, with numerical errors evaluated using an analysis code
  created by members of the NRAR collaboration. We compare previously-
  calibrated, non-precessing analytical waveforms, notably the
  effective-one-body (EOB) and phenomenological template families, to
  the newly-produced numerical waveforms. We find that when the
  binary's total mass is ∼100–200M⊙, current EOB and phenomenological
  models of spinning, non-precessing binary waveforms have overlaps
  above 99% (for advanced LIGO) with all of the non-precessing-binary
  numerical waveforms with mass ratios ⩽4, when maximizing over binary
  parameters. This implies that the loss of event rate due to
  modelling error is below 3%. Moreover, the non-spinning EOB
  waveforms previously calibrated to five non-spinning waveforms with
  mass ratio smaller than 6 have overlaps above 99.7% with the
  numerical waveform with a mass ratio of 10, without even maximizing
  on the binary parameters.
