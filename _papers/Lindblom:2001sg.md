  Nonlinear evolution of the gravitational radiation (GR) driven
  instability in the r-modes of neutron stars is studied by full
  numerical 3D hydrodynamical simulations. The growth of the r-mode
  instability is found to be limited by the formation of shocks and
  breaking waves when the dimensionless amplitude of the mode grows to
  about three in value. This maximum mode amplitude is shown by
  numerical tests to be rather insensitive to the strength of the GR
  driving force. Upper limits on the strengths of possible nonlinear
  mode--mode coupling are inferred. Previously unpublished details of
  the numerical techniques used are presented, and the results of
  numerous calibration runs are discussed.
