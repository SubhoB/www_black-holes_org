  We present accurate fits for the remnant properties of generically
  precessing binary black holes, trained on large banks of numerical-
  relativity simulations. We use Gaussian process regression to
  interpolate the remnant mass, spin, and recoil velocity in the
  seven-dimensional parameter space of precessing black-hole binaries
  with mass ratios q≤2, and spin magnitudes χ1, χ2≤0.8. For precessing
  systems, our errors in estimating the remnant mass, spin magnitude,
  and kick magnitude are lower than those of existing fitting formulae
  by at least an order of magnitude (improvement is also reported in
  the extrapolated region at high mass ratios and spins). In addition,
  we also model the remnant spin and kick directions. Being trained
  directly on precessing simulations, our fits are free from
  ambiguities regarding the initial frequency at which precessing
  quantities are defined. We also construct a model for remnant
  properties of aligned-spin systems with mass ratios q≤8, and spin
  magnitudes χ1, χ2≤0.8. As a byproduct, we also provide error
  estimates for all fitted quantities, which can be consistently
  incorporated into current and future gravitational-wave parameter-
  estimation analyses. Our model(s) are made publicly available
  through a fast and easy-to-use Python module called surfinBH.
