  We report results from simulations in general relativity of
  magnetized disks accreting onto merging black hole binaries,
  starting from relaxed disk initial data. The simulations feature an
  effective, rapid radiative cooling scheme as a limiting case of
  future treatments with radiative transfer. Here we evolve the
  systems after binary-disk decoupling through inspiral and merger,
  and analyze the dependence on the binary mass ratio with
  q≡mbh/MBH=1,1/2, and 1/4. We find that the luminosity associated
  with local cooling is larger than the luminosity associated with
  matter kinetic outflows, while the electromagnetic (Poynting)
  luminosity associated with bulk transport of magnetic field energy
  is the smallest. The cooling luminosity around merger is only
  marginally smaller than that of a single, non-spinning black
  hole. Incipient jets are launched independently of the mass ratio,
  while the same initial disk accreting on a single non-spinning black
  hole does not lead to a jet, as expected. For all mass ratios we see
  a transient behavior in the collimated, magnetized outflows lasting
  2−5(M/108M⊙)days after merger: the outflows become increasingly
  magnetically dominated and accelerated to higher velocities,
  boosting the Poynting luminosity. These sudden changes can alter the
  electromagnetic emission across the jet and potentially help
  distinguish mergers of black holes in AGNs from single accreting
  black holes based on jet morphology alone.
