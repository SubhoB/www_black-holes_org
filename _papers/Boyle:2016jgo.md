  A common problem in physics and engineering is determination of the
  orientation of an object given its angular velocity. When the
  direction of the angular velocity changes in time, this is a
  nontrivial problem involving coupled differential equations. Several
  possible approaches are examined, along with various improvements
  over previous efforts. These are then evaluated numerically by
  comparison to a complicated but analytically known rotation that is
  motivated by the important astrophysical problem of precessing
  black-hole binaries. It is shown that a straightforward solution
  directly using quaternions is most efficient and accurate, and that
  the norm of the quaternion is irrelevant. Integration of the
  generator of the rotation can also be made roughly as efficient as
  integration of the rotation. Both methods will typically be twice as
  efficient as naive vector- or matrix-based methods. Implementation
  by means of standard general-purpose numerical integrators is stable
  and efficient, so that such problems can be readily solved as part
  of a larger system of differential equations. Possible
  generalization to integration in other Lie groups is also discussed.
