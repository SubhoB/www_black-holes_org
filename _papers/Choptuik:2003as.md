  We present a new numerical code designed to solve the Einstein field
  equations for axisymmetric spacetimes. The long term goal of this
  project is to construct a code that will be capable of studying many
  problems of interest in axisymmetry, including gravitational
  collapse, critical phenomena, investigations of cosmic censorship,
  and head-on black hole collisions. Our objective here is to detail
  the (2+1)+1 formalism we use to arrive at the corresponding system
  of equations and the numerical methods we use to solve them. We are
  able to obtain stable evolution, despite the singular nature of the
  coordinate system on the axis, by enforcing appropriate regularity
  conditions on all variables and by adding numerical dissipation to
  hyperbolic equations.
