  Black-hole–neutron-star mergers resulting in the disruption of the
  neutron star and the formation of an accretion disk and/or the
  ejection of unbound material are prime candidates for the joint
  detection of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals when the
  next generation of gravitational-wave detectors comes online.
  However, the disruption of the neutron star and the properties of
  the postmerger remnant are very sensitive to the parameters of the
  binary (mass ratio, black-hole spin, neutron star radius). In this
  paper, we study the impact of the radius of the neutron star and the
  alignment of the black-hole spin on black-hole–neutron-star mergers
  within the range of mass ratio currently deemed most likely for
  field binaries (MBH∼7MNS) and for black-hole spins large enough for
  the neutron star to disrupt (JBH/MBH2=0.9). We find that (i) In this
  regime, the merger is particularly sensitive to the radius of the
  neutron star, with remnant masses varying from 0.3MNS to 0.1MNS for
  changes of only 2 km in the NS radius; (ii) 0.01M⊙–0.05M⊙ of unbound
  material can be ejected with kinetic energy ≳1051  ergs, a
  significant increase compared to low mass ratio, low spin binaries.
  This ejecta could power detectable postmerger optical and radio
  afterglows. (iii) Only a small fraction of the Advanced LIGO events
  in this parameter range have gravitational-wave signals which could
  offer constraints on the equation of state of the neutron star (at
  best ∼3% of the events for a single detector at design sensitivity).
  (iv) A misaligned black-hole spin works against disk formation, with
  less neutron-star material remaining outside of the black hole after
  merger, and a larger fraction of that material remaining in the
  tidal tail instead of the forming accretion disk. (v) Large kicks
  vkick≳300  km/s can be given to the final black hole as a result of
  a precessing black-hole–neutron-star merger, when the disruption of
  the neutron star occurs just outside or within the innermost stable
  spherical orbit.
