  In calculations of the inspiral of binary black holes an
  intermediate approximation is needed that can bridge the
  post-Newtonian methods of the early inspiral and the numerical
  relativity computations of the final plunge. We describe here the
  periodic standing wave approximation: A numerical solution is found
  to the problem of a periodic rotating binary with helically
  symmetric standing wave fields, and from this solution an
  approximation is extracted for the physically relevant problem of
  inspiral with outgoing waves. The approximation underlying this
  approach has been recently confirmed with innovative numerical
  methods applied to nonlinear model problems.
