  Observation and characterization of gravitational waves from binary
  black holes requires accurate knowledge of the expected waveforms.
  The late inspiral and merger phase of the waveform is obtained
  through direct numerical integration of the full 3-dimensional
  Einstein equations. The Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) utilizes a
  multi-domain pseudo-spectral method tightly adapted to the geometry
  of the black holes; it is computationally efficient and accurate,
  but—for high mass-ratios and large spins—sometimes requires manual
  fine-tuning for the merger-phase of binaries. The Einstein Toolkit
  (ET) employs finite difference methods and the moving puncture
  technique; it is less computationally efficient, but highly robust.
  For some mergers with high mass ratio and large spins, the efficient
  numerical algorithms used in SpEC have failed, whereas the simpler
  algorithms used in the ET were successful. Given the urgent need of
  testing the accuracy of waveform models currently used in LIGO and
  Virgo inference analyses for high mass ratios and spins, we present
  here a synergistic approach to numerical-relativity: We combine SpEC
  and ET waveforms into complete inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms,
  taking advantage of the computational efficiency of the pseudo-
  spectral code during the inspiral, and the robustness of the finite-
  difference code at the merger. We validate our method against a case
  where complete waveforms from both codes are available, compute
  three new hybrid numerical-relativity waveforms, and compare them
  with analytical waveform models currently used in LIGO and Virgo
  science. All the waveforms and the hybridization code are publicly
  available.
