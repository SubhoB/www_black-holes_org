abstract: |
  The evolution of a neutron-star r-mode driven unstable by
  gravitational radiation (GR) is studied here using numerical
  solutions of the full non-linear fluid equations. The amplitude of
  the mode grows to order unity before strong shocks develop which
  quickly damp the mode. In this simulation the star loses about 40%
  of its initial angular momentum and 50% of its rotational kinetic
  energy before the mode is damped. The non-linear evolution causes
  the fluid to develop strong differential rotation which is
  concentrated near the surface and especially near the poles of the
  star.
