  We report on simulations in general relativity of magnetized disks
  onto black hole binaries. We vary the binary mass ratio from 1:1 to
  1:10 and evolve the systems when they orbit near the binary-disk
  decoupling radius. We compare (surface) density profiles, accretion
  rates (relative to a single, non-spinning black hole), variability,
  effective α-stress levels and luminosities as functions of the mass
  ratio. We treat the disks in two limiting regimes: rapid radiative
  cooling and no radiative cooling. The magnetic field lines clearly
  reveal jets emerging from both black hole horizons and merging into
  one common jet at large distances. The magnetic fields give rise to
  much stronger shock heating than the pure hydrodynamic flows,
  completely alter the disk structure, and boost accretion rates and
  luminosities. Accretion streams near the horizons are among the
  densest structures; in fact, the 1:10 no-cooling evolution results
  in a refilling of the cavity. The typical effective temperature in
  the bulk of the disk is ∼105(M/108M⊙)−1/4(L/Ledd)1/4K yielding
  characteristic thermal frequencies
  ∼1015(M/108M⊙)−1/4(L/Ledd)1/4(1+z)−1Hz. These systems are thus
  promising targets for many extragalactic optical surveys, such as
  LSST, WFIRST, and PanSTARRS.
