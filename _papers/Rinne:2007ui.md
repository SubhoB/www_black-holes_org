  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity
  are compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole
  with an outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical
  solutions computed using different boundary treatments are compared
  to a `reference' numerical solution obtained by placing the outer
  boundary at a very large radius. For each boundary treatment, the
  full solutions including constraint violations and extracted
  gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,
  thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial
  boundary. These tests use a first-order generalized harmonic
  formulation of the Einstein equations. Constraint-preserving
  boundary conditions for this system are reviewed, and an improved
  boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is
  presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include
  freezing the incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary
  conditions, and the constraint-preserving boundary conditions of
  Kreiss and Winicour. Rather different approaches to boundary
  treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial compactification, are
  also tested. Overall the best treatment found here combines boundary
  conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the Newman-Penrose
  scalar \(\Psi_0\), and control gauge reflections.
