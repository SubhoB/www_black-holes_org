  Building initial conditions for generic binary black-hole evolutions
  without initial spurious eccentricity remains a challenge for
  numerical-relativity simulations. This problem can be overcome by
  applying an eccentricity-removal procedure which consists in
  evolving the binary for a couple of orbits, estimating the
  eccentricity, and then correcting the initial conditions. The
  presence of spins can complicate this procedure. As predicted by
  post-Newtonian theory, spin-spin interactions and precession prevent
  the binary from moving along an adiabatic sequence of spherical
  orbits, inducing oscillations in the radial separation and in the
  orbital frequency. However, spin-induced oscillations occur at
  approximately twice the orbital frequency, therefore they can be
  distinguished from the initial spurious eccentricity, which occurs
  at approximately the orbital frequency. We develop a new removal
  procedure based on the derivative of the orbital frequency and find
  that it is successful in reducing the eccentricity measured in the
  orbital frequency to less than 0.0001 when moderate spins are
  present. We test this new procedure using numerical-relativity
  simulations of binary black holes with mass ratios 1.5 and 3, spin
  magnitude 0.5 and various spin orientations. The numerical
  simulations exhibit spin-induced oscillations in the dynamics at
  approximately twice the orbital frequency. Oscillations of similar
  frequency are also visible in the gravitational-wave phase and
  frequency of the dominant mode.
