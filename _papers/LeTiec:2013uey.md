  We study the general relativistic periastron advance in spinning
  black hole binaries on quasicircular orbits, with spins aligned or
  antialigned with the orbital angular momentum, using numerical-
  relativity simulations, the post-Newtonian approximation, and black
  hole perturbation theory. By imposing a symmetry by exchange of the
  bodies’ labels, we devise an improved version of the perturbative
  result and use it as the leading term of a new type of expansion in
  powers of the symmetric mass ratio. This allows us to measure, for
  the first time, the gravitational self-force effect on the
  periastron advance of a nonspinning particle orbiting a Kerr black
  hole of mass M and spin S=-0.5M2, down to separations of order 9M.
  Comparing the predictions of our improved perturbative expansion
  with the exact results from numerical simulations of equal-mass and
  equal-spin binaries, we find a remarkable agreement over a wide
  range of spins and orbital separations.
