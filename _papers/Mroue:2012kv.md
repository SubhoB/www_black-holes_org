  In numerical evolutions of binary black holes (BBH) it is desirable
  to easily control the orbital eccentricity of the BBH, and the
  number of orbits completed by the binary through merger. This paper
  presents fitting formulae that allow to choose initial-data
  parameters for generic precessing BBH resulting in an orbital
  eccentricity \(\sim 10^{-4}\), and that allow to predict the number
  of orbits to merger. We further demonstrate how these fits can be
  used to choose initial-data parameters of desired non-zero
  eccentricity. For both usage scenarios, no costly exploratory BBH
  evolutions are necessary, but both usage scenarios retain the
  freedom to refine the fitted parameters further based on the results
  of BBH evolutions. The presented fitting formulas are based on 729
  BBH configurations which are iteratively reduced to eccentricity
  \(\lesssim 10^{-4}\), covering mass-ratios between 1 and 8 and
  spin-magnitude up to 0.5. 101 of these configurations are evolved
  through the BBH inspiral phase.
