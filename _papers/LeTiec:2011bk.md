abstract: |
  The general relativistic (Mercury-type) periastron advance is
  calculated here for the first time with exquisite precision in full
  general relativity. We use accurate numerical relativity simulations
  of spinless black hole binaries with mass ratios 1/8 < m1/m2 < 1 and
  compare with the predictions of several analytic approximation
  schemes. We find the effective-one-body model to be remarkably
  accurate, and, surprisingly, so also the predictions of self-force
  theory [replacing m1/m2 --> m1m2/(m1+m2)^2]. Our results can inform
  a universal analytic model of the two-body dynamics, crucial for
  ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches.
