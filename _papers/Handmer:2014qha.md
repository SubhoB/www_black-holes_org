  We present a spectral algorithm for solving the full nonlinear
  vacuum Einstein field equations in the Bondi framework. Developed
  within the Spectral Einstein Code, we demonstrate spectral
  characteristic evolution as a technical precursor to Cauchy
  characteristic extraction, a rigorous method for obtaining gauge-
  invariant gravitational waveforms from existing and future
  astrophysical simulations. We demonstrate the new algorithmʼs
  stability, convergence, and agreement with existing evolution
  methods. We explain how an innovative spectral approach enables a
  two orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency.
