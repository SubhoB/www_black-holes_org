  We present a first exploration of the results of neutron star-black
  hole mergers using black hole masses in the most likely range of
  7M⊙−10M⊙, a neutrino leakage scheme, and a modeling of the neutron
  star material through a finite-temperature nuclear-theory based
  equation of state. In the range of black hole spins in which the
  neutron star is tidally disrupted (χBH≳0.7), we show that the merger
  consistently produces large amounts of cool (T≲1MeV), unbound,
  neutron-rich material (Mej∼0.05M⊙−0.20M⊙). A comparable amount of
  bound matter is initially divided between a hot disk (Tmax∼15MeV)
  with typical neutrino luminosity Lν∼1053erg/s, and a cooler tidal
  tail. After a short period of rapid protonization of the disk
  lasting ∼10ms, the accretion disk cools down under the combined
  effects of the fall-back of cool material from the tail, continued
  accretion of the hottest material onto the black hole, and neutrino
  emission. As the temperature decreases, the disk progressively
  becomes more neutron-rich, with dimmer neutrino emission. This
  cooling process should stop once the viscous heating in the disk
  (not included in our simulations) balances the cooling. These
  mergers of neutron star-black hole binaries with black hole masses
  MBH∼7M⊙−10M⊙ and black hole spins high enough for the neutron star
  to disrupt provide promising candidates for the production of short
  gamma-ray bursts, of bright infrared post-merger signals due to the
  radioactive decay of unbound material, and of large amounts of
  r-process nuclei.
