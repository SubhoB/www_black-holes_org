  We investigate the late time behavior of a scalar field on a fixed
  Kerr background using a 2+1 dimensional pseudospectral evolution
  code. We compare evolutions of pure axisymmetric multipoles in both
  Kerr-Schild and Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We find that the
  late-time power-law decay rate depends upon the slicing of the
  background, confirming previous theoretical predictions for those
  decay rates. The accuracy of the numerical evolutions is sufficient
  to decide unambiguously between competing claims in the literature.
