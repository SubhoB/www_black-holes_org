  Binary black hole simulations starting from quasi-circular (i.e.,
  zero radial velocity) initial data have orbits with small but
  non-zero orbital eccentricities. In this paper the quasi-equilibrium
  initial-data method is extended to allow non-zero radial velocities
  to be specified in binary black hole initial data. New
  low-eccentricity initial data are obtained by adjusting the orbital
  frequency and radial velocities to minimize the orbital
  eccentricity, and the resulting (\(\sim 5\) orbit) evolutions are
  compared with those of quasi-circular initial data. Evolutions of
  the quasi-circular data clearly show eccentric orbits, with
  eccentricity that decays over time. The precise decay rate depends
  on the definition of eccentricity; if defined in terms of variations
  in the orbital frequency, the decay rate agrees well with the
  prediction of Peters (1964). The gravitational waveforms, which
  contain \(\sim 8\) cycles in the dominant \(l=m=2\) mode, are
  largely unaffected by the eccentricity of the quasi-circular initial
  data. The overlap between the dominant mode in the quasi-circular
  evolution and the same mode in the low-eccentricity evolution is
  about 0.99.
