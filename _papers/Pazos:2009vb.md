  We present numerical simulations of orbiting black holes for around
  twelve cycles, using a high-order multipatch approach. Unlike some
  other approaches, the computational speed scales almost perfectly
  for thousands of processors. Multipatch methods are an alternative
  to AMR (adaptive mesh refinement), with benefits of simplicity and
  better scaling for improving the resolution in the wave zone. The
  results presented here pave the way for multipatch evolutions of
  black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star binaries,
  where high resolution grids are needed to resolve details of the
  matter flow.
