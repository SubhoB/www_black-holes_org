  Testing general relativity in the nonlinear, dynamical, strong-field
  regime of gravity is one of the major goals of gravitational wave
  astrophysics. Performing precision tests of general relativity (GR)
  requires numerical inspiral, merger, and ringdown waveforms for
  binary black hole (BBH) systems in theories beyond GR. Currently, GR
  and scalar-tensor gravity are the only theories amenable to
  numerical simulations. In this article, we present a well-posed
  perturbation scheme for numerically integrating beyond-GR theories
  that have a continuous limit to GR. We demonstrate this scheme by
  simulating BBH mergers in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity (dCS), to
  linear order in the perturbation parameter. We present mode
  waveforms and energy fluxes of the dCS pseudoscalar field from our
  numerical simulations. We find good agreement with analytic
  predictions at early times, including the absence of pseudoscalar
  dipole radiation. We discover new phenomenology only accessible
  through numerics: a burst of dipole radiation during merger. We also
  quantify the self-consistency of the perturbation scheme. Finally,
  we estimate bounds that GR-consistent LIGO detections could place on
  the new dCS length scale, approximately ℓ≲O(10)  km.
