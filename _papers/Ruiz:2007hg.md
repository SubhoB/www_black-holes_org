  We analyze Einstein's vacuum field equations in generalized harmonic
  coordinates on a compact spatial domain with boundaries. We specify
  a class of boundary conditions which is constraint-preserving and
  sufficiently general to include recent proposals for reducing the
  amount of spurious reflections of gravitational radiation. In
  particular, our class comprises the boundary conditions recently
  proposed by Kreiss and Winicour, a geometric modification thereof,
  the freezing-\(\Psi_0\) boundary condition and the hierarchy of
  absorbing boundary conditions introduced by Buchman and
  Sarbach. Using the recent technique developed by Kreiss and Winicour
  based on an appropriate reduction to a pseudo-differential first
  order system, we prove well posedness of the resulting
  initial-boundary value problem in the frozen coefficient
  approximation. In view of the theory of pseudo-differential
  operators it is expected that the full nonlinear problem is also
  well posed. Furthermore, we implement some of our boundary
  conditions numerically and study their effectiveness in a test
  problem consisting of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole.
