  We compute the periastron advance using the effective-one-body
  formalism for binary black holes moving on quasicircular orbits and
  having spins collinear with the orbital angular momentum. We compare
  the predictions with the periastron advance recently computed in
  accurate numerical-relativity simulations and find remarkable
  agreement for a wide range of spins and mass ratios. These results
  do not use any numerical-relativity calibration of the effective-
  one-body model, and stem from two key ingredients in the effective-
  one-body Hamiltonian: (i) the mapping of the two-body dynamics of
  spinning particles onto the dynamics of an effective spinning
  particle in a (deformed) Kerr spacetime, fully symmetrized with
  respect to the two-body masses and spins, and (ii) the resummation,
  in the test-particle limit, of all post-Newtonian corrections linear
  in the spin of the particle. In fact, even when only the leading
  spin post-Newtonian corrections are included in the effective-one-
  body spinning Hamiltonian but all the test-particle corrections
  linear in the spin of the particle are resummed we find very good
  agreement with the numerical results (within the numerical error for
  equal-mass binaries and discrepancies of at most 1% for larger mass
  ratios). Furthermore, we specialize to the extreme mass-ratio limit
  and derive, using the equations of motion in the gravitational
  skeleton approach, analytical expressions for the periastron
  advance, the meridional Lense-Thirring precession and spin
  precession frequency in the case of a spinning particle on a nearly
  circular equatorial orbit in Kerr spacetime, including also terms
  quadratic in the spin.
