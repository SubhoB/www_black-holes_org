  This paper is concerned with the initial-boundary value problem for
  the Einstein equations in a first-order generalized harmonic
  formulation. We impose boundary conditions that preserve the
  constraints and control the incoming gravitational radiation by
  prescribing data for the incoming fields of the Weyl
  tensor. High-frequency perturbations about any given spacetime
  (including a shift vector with subluminal normal component) are
  analyzed using the Fourier-Laplace technique. We show that the
  system is boundary-stable. In addition, we develop a criterion that
  can be used to detect weak instabilities with polynomial time
  dependence, and we show that our system does not suffer from such
  instabilities. A numerical robust stability test supports our claim
  that the initial-boundary value problem is most likely to be
  well-posed even if nonzero initial and source data are included.
