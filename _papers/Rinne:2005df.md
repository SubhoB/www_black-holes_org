  This thesis is concerned with formulations of the Einstein equations
  in axisymmetric spacetimes which are suitable for numerical
  evolutions. We develop two evolution systems based on the (2+1)+1
  formalism. The first is a (partially) constrained scheme with
  elliptic gauge conditions arising from maximal slicing and conformal
  flatness. The second is a strongly hyperbolic first-order
  formulation obtained by combining the (2+1)+1 formalism with the Z4
  formalism. A careful study of the behaviour of regular axisymmetric
  tensor fields enables us to cast the equations in a form that is
  well-behaved on the axis. Further topics include (non)uniqueness of
  solutions to the elliptic equations arising in constrained schemes,
  and comparisons between various boundary conditions used in
  numerical relativity. The numerical implementation is applied to
  adaptive evolutions of nonlinear Brill waves, including twist.
