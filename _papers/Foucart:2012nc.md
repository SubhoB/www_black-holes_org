  Determining the final result of black hole-neutron star mergers, and
  in particular the amount of matter remaining outside the black hole
  at late times and its properties, has been one of the main
  motivations behind the numerical simulation of these systems. Black
  hole-neutron star binaries are amongst the most likely progenitors
  of short gamma-ray bursts --- as long as massive (probably a few
  percents of a solar mass), hot accretion disks are formed around the
  black hole. Whether this actually happens strongly depends on the
  physical characteristics of the system, and in particular on the
  mass ratio, the spin of the black hole, and the radius of the
  neutron star. We present here a simple two-parameter model, fitted
  to existing numerical results, for the determination of the mass
  remaining outside the black hole a few milliseconds after a black
  hole-neutron star merger (i.e. the combined mass of the accretion
  disk, the tidal tail, and the potential ejecta). This model predicts
  the remnant mass within a few percents of the mass of the neutron
  star, at least for remnant masses up to 20% of the neutron star
  mass. Results across the range of parameters deemed to be the most
  likely astrophysically are presented here. We find that, for 10
  solar mass black holes, massive disks are only possible for large
  neutron stars (R>12km), or quasi-extremal black hole spins
  (a/M>0.9). We also use our model to discuss how the equation of
  state of the neutron star affects the final remnant, and the strong
  influence that this can have on the rate of short gamma-ray bursts
  produced by black hole-neutron star mergers.
