  This paper is concerned exclusively with axisymmetric spacetimes. We
  want to develop reductions of Einstein's equations which are
  suitable for numerical evolutions. We first make a Kaluza-Klein type
  dimensional reduction followed by an ADM reduction on the Lorentzian
  3-space, the (2+1)+1 formalism. We include also the Z4 extension of
  Einstein's equations adapted to this formalism. Our gauge choice is
  based on a generalized harmonic gauge condition. We consider vacuum
  and perfect fluid sources. We use these ingredients to construct a
  strongly hyperbolic first-order evolution system and exhibit its
  characteristic structure. This enables us to construct
  constraint-preserving stable outer boundary conditions. We use
  cylindrical polar coordinates and so we provide a careful discussion
  of the coordinate singularity on axis. By choosing our dependent
  variables appropriately we are able to produce an evolution system
  in which each and every term is manifestly regular on axis.
