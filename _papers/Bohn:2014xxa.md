  We present a method of calculating the strong-field gravitational
  lensing caused by many analytic and numerical spacetimes. We use
  this procedure to calculate the distortion caused by isolated black
  holes (BHs) and by numerically evolved BH binaries. We produce both
  demonstrative images illustrating details of the spatial distortion
  and realistic images of collections of stars taking both lensing
  amplification and redshift into account. On large scales the lensing
  from inspiraling binaries resembles that of single BHs, but on small
  scales the resulting images show complex and in some cases self-
  similar structure across different angular scales.
