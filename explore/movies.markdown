## Highly-precessing binary black hole run

{% include youtube-embed.html id="grA5KfDlsAY" %}

Binary black hole system with spin of 0.91 on the large hole and 0.3
on the small hole. The mass ratio is 6:1. Colors indicate the
vorticity of the apparent horizon and arrows denote the spin
directions. The large spin produces significant orbital
precession. Movie rendered by Robert McGehee and Alex Streicher.

## Vortex-Tendex Visualization
### Head-on Collision of Equal-Mass Black Holes with Transvere Spins

The spins of the black holes are transverse to the infall direction,
anti-aligned and of magnitude 0.5. This simulation is descrbed in
[Phys. Rev. D **82**,
064031](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.82.064031),
also available at
[arXiv:gr-qc/0907.0869](http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0869).

### Inspiral of Equal-Mass Black Holes with Spin Anti-Aligned to the Orbital Angular Momentum and of Magnitude 0.95

The spins have magnitude 0.95, are parallel to each other, but are
anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum. This simulation is
described in [Phys. Rev. D **83**,
024010](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.83.024010),
also available at [arXiv:1010.2777](http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2777).

Penrose-Rindler complex curvature, κ) on the apparent horizons
{% include youtube-embed.html id="MgX-7kRkx7I" %}

* The evolution of the scalar curvature, R, on the apparent horizons
{% include youtube-embed.html id="vNWQLqefUps" %}

Note that aside from corrections that become important only near the
time of merger, the spin function _χ_ and scalar curvature
_R_ should agree well with -2B<sub>nn</sub> and -2E<sub>nn</sub>,
respectively, where B<sub>nn</sub> and E<sub>nn</sub> are the horizon
vorticity and tendicity, respectively.

### "Extreme-Kick" Merger: Inspiral of Equal-Mass Black Holes with Spins Anti-parallel and Oriented in the Orbital Plane

The spins of the black holes are anti-parallel, oriented in the
orbital plane, and are of magnitude 0.5. In this configuration, the
kick of the final black hole has been observed in simulations by
[Campanelli et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0702133) to depend on
the phase of the binary at the time of merger; more specifically, they
found that the kick depended sinusoidally upon the angle between the
initial momenta of the BHs and the spins. This simulation will be
detailed a future publication in progress; it is discussed in
[Phys. Rev. Lett. **106**,
151101](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.151101),
also available at [arXiv:1012.4869](http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4869).

## Binary Orbit & Collision, Head-on Collision

The following movie is divided into two parts, each part showing a
different numerical simulation, with brief captions that describe what
is being shown. **Part 1:** Binary black holes orbit, lose energy
because of gravitational radiation, and finally collide, forming a
single black hole; gravitational waveform, spacetime curvature, and
orbital trajectories are shown. **Part 2:** Event horizon and
apparent horizons for the head-on collision of two black holes.

## Falling Spacetime

{% include youtube-embed.html id="p647WrQd684" %}

The upper movie shows in the upper half of the screen the orbits and
the apparent horizons of the two holes, in the coordinate system used
in the computation. The bottom half of the screen shows the spacetime
geometry in the holes' orbital plane. The depth of the surface is
proportional to the scalar curvature of space. (For the
two-dimensional orbital plane the full spatial curvature is determined
by the scalar curvature.) The colors encode the lapse function --- the
slowing of the rate of flow of time. The arrows show minus the shift ---
which can be thought of as the velocity of flow of space. The
beginning of the inspiral is shown, and then the last several orbits,
the merger of the two holes, and the vibrational ringdown.

The final hole does not look pefectly spherical because the computer
code that created this movie chose spatial slices with a bit of
crinkliness in them at the end. This simulation lasts for 16 inspiral
orbits, followed by merger and ringdown, and it achieves a cumulative
phase accuracy for the emitted gravitational waves of about 0.02
radians (out of roughly 200 radians, i.e. a fractional phase error of
1 part in 10,000).

Tehnical details of the simulation on which this movie is based can be
found in [a paper by the Caltech-Cornell
group](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0810.1767). Note that slightly
different data is used in that paper; the spatial slices are chosen
without the "crinkles".

## Gravitational Waves From a Pair of Black Holes From Large Distance

{% include youtube-embed.html id="zffBzBW6Y3s" %}

On the right side, this movie shows the gravitational waves emitted by
a pair of black holes from large distance. The black holes themselves
are in the center of the ball, too small to be seen. Toward the left
of the ball showing gravitational waves, there is a little grey
dot. The red line on the left side shows the gravitational wave
strength which would be observed if a gravitational wave detector
would have been at that place. If you look carefully, you'll notice
that gravitational waves are emitted in all directions, but that the
waves are strongest in the "upward direction", which is normal to the
orbital plane of the holes. This is an older movie, which stops just
before the black holes collide.


## Gravitational Waves From a Pair of Black Holes Orbiting Each Other

{% include youtube-embed.html id="Xn-4N4JZYKA" %}

This movie shows a pair of black holes orbiting each other, giving off
gravitational waves. The movie begins with a close-up view of the
holes. We zoom out, to show some of the surrounding spacetime. As the
holes go around, they give off waves. After an initial burst of "junk
radiation" (unrealistic artifacts of the simulation), the animation
speeds up --- just so it doesn't take so long --- and we see nice
spiral-shaped waves. Gradually, the black holes begin to orbit faster
and faster. As they do, the waves become more and more intense. If you
watch carefully, you can see the circles on the top and sides
oscillating, <a href="index.php?Itemid=184" title="Gravitational Wave
AStronomy">just as you would expect from a passing gravitational
wave</a>.

## Precessing Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger

{% include youtube-embed.html id="6g807FFZYqM" %}

This movie shows the merger of a black hole-neutron star binary in
which the spin of the black hole is not aligned with the total angular
momentum of the system, thus causing the orbital plane to precess. The
black hole is 3 times more massive than the neutron star, and has a
spin a=0.5 at an initial inclination of 80 degrees with respect to the
orbital angular momentum of the binary. The main frame shows the
evolution of the system from slightly above the initial equatorial
plane, with the color scale giving the density of matter within the
star, while the smaller panel shows the same system viewed from an
"edge-on" position (i.e.: as seen by an observer located in the
initial equatorial plane).

The binary goes through about 2 orbits, during which the separation
between the compact objects drops from 60km to 30km. Then, tidal
forces disrupt the neutron star. Most of the matter (~97%) is rapidly
accreted by the black hole, while the rest forms a long tidal tail
which eventually settles into an accretion disk. The relative
precession of the star, tail and disk is clearly visible in the
edge-on view. Towards the end of the simulation, the spin of the black
hole and the angular momentum of the disk are misaligned by about 20
degrees, which will cause the precession of the disk over longer
timescales.

## Merging Event Horizons

{% include youtube-embed.html id="Tr1zDVbSjTM" %}

This movie shows the event horizons of two black holes merging into a
single black hole. The holes have a 2:1 mass ratio, with spins of
approximately 0.4 in random directions. The merger simulation has been
published in [arXiv:gr-qc/0909.3557](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3557),
by Bela Szilagyi, Lee Lindblom and Mark Scheel at Caltech. The event
horizon tracking was performed by Michael Cohen at Caltech.
