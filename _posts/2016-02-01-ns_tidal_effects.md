# Tidal effects in neutron star-compact object binaries

To detect and characterize gravitational waves from neutron star binaries, LIGO needs good models of
all possible signals.  Numerical relativity can't practically be used for every case, but it is
needed to test and calibrate the simpler models that LIGO can use.  Inspiral waveforms from binaries
with neutron stars differ from binary black hole waveforms by the presence of tidal forces.  In [a
recent paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00599), Tanja Hinderer and collaborators use SXS black
hole-neutron star simulations to validate a new model of these tidal forces.  They find that tidal
effects can be stronger than previously expected when they come close to resonance with a neutron
star's preferred ways of ringing (its normal modes of oscillation).
